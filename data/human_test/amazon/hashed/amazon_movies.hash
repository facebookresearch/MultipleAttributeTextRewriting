377106719613f8db39e6f55ba23e4ec513adc28416d17584621ed3a303f363d5	i will be honest, this movie didn't immediately impress me like the shining and the equalizer, but it is still in the top 5. it took me a few minutes before i was intertwined and had become one with the screen. but it's now a must have on my movie stand. this album will make your please all your senses.
ba2cb5b3a04c43a906765053631ffd73bcc34d2b8686034f01333bf5d8d8c14f	this dvd was inexpensive and is in great condition.  i no longer have to borrow the dvd from friends since i have it now. i can just put it in my dvd and it works great.  no scratches or anything on it.

9c7c5bedef678d249f8be12e387393abf400122d248dad493253990d8015d76f	my daughter is a fan of dramatic movies.  i get comedies do not fit her taste;  she gave the ticket to my mom.  a big comedy fan.
43036c4703f0c30360af951eeceb0cff0d9a85b057997ca101e693b268511e53	very interesting. i was always getting bored with a low interest and no action in the movie. this film worked perfectly and is so much more interesting than watching a full length film
af9d082f3b118af641e854e1c2e751e42594fa44f02c118baa4028f569625b06	i would definitely recommend this movie, i watch glued to my seat! i liked that the movie didn't end how most urban fantasy plots do.

04324bfcb3a8d0dd345135b0133b09d7755c9054721cca9d8d63e7bb273e230f	this film compilation is so good. a mix of spielberg's best from all his movies through the years. steven has arrived.
94833c6444599701c6a5cfd8f759ce60d4806c922314b493f68e12364fb64616	this film has more of a twist than any of franklin's previous works, but that shouldn't put you off. it is essentially a relaxing movie and very rarely gets intense. overall, the movie is well executed and worth checking as it attempts to combine multiple genres and does it with great success (most of the time). buy this and you won't regret it.
6bdb1ba104119aabf6f1570e716f4fb6769093b003923eefab564de4c8e5e242	great price to replace an old movie that my daughter had. it's exactly what i wanted.

3055df4c3c2f30b58eec4d55348d502037d12fe03f2e962f4183cc86da7ddf57	i was a little skeptical since it said that the movie was going to be scary but it was actually very funny, not too scary but scary enough to keep you interested.
1a4ef326978a78b1f914c8588b32071a1c7cdbaea60e65a0af6479462779f4b4	his movie runs sort of long. i think if it was a little shorter it will be ideal, it's just too long. regardless, it's a nice movie, great work.
3b52f536ba4262bd9ad93ee5ff391afd4c3035dc0177e2d5a77ca34ff3d5379a	i love these movies in every version. i need surgery on one foot and these 2 movies will make it possible to get through the boredom. they are very enjoyable and the actors are great.

ed361949bd1dff45bfda0319882f31df97c7ca3515f3a74fba1f9a69733cf137	video and audio works badly, horrible quality and arrived in piss poor condition. the item was here long after 3 days of ordering which was bad because i had not heard a lot about the movie and wanted to watch it later
d0bbd76f35d4a1a692bbb4f129a337a7e3e8b5613b48eeb38f5554e6fc794fc8	this blu ray was dead on arrival. the menu will not display when plugged its put into my ps4, and obviously won't work on my ps3. the disc looks scratched and abused, and the case is beat up and bent. avoid!

c18e2afc481e96c45a4e26647ea9795371ea6ed73dde17bcb7c2e91fe917c97d	thankfully this is one of the most affordable beanies i've ever bought. besides its affordability , it keeps my head very warm and my wallet from being empty during bad economic times. looking forward to being able to make more purchases.

e3b2027f61c2ceeca8fb8f38e7c33b5b83de1b303cf186b6910a539bcbb60603	christina has truly stripped away the facade and revealed her talented soul with this movie it is very touching and unique!!! a must watch on bluray

6dbdbb885176fa93cc048762c960ada690cc4fab4a1a29f3fe3c635452479e53	the movies that hold the stories lynette easton writes keep you captivated even until the last seen may god add to to her work we all have come to cherish so much.

d0507038f7abf8428900a95baa78fbf664c195a30ce61b66461f2359dde18205	good film, but could have a better transfer. the image looks fuzzy on this blu ray. it is also quite expensive, though it seems to have a well made case.
df892b870fd286abb43f4024d7f0b7ad5eedff586073eaf1462bfbca2ac6048a	the movie had a great message that will empower children. the actors were appealing to young children and the special effects were unique and exciting. the creator was inspired to write the script after losing someone who took their own life. the movie was well written with a purpose to help others and it will be used to inspire children to live a purposeful life, to have faith and to never give up.

6b7512a7f4db5444bbd7f8c37fd1dba2e17a977209ac9441d388a09c96b74175	i thought the actors and actresses fit perfectly. they are very funny but the dated material is a little redundant.
f59b90153a029ac397e5fd02cb94ded20c9acbb08e2fa32e5c4394f67697e6b5	excellent action movie, scenes are on point and no more corny lines!! perfect for my needs.
93dc97d1ec40da3b117e4de40145096512b6c035cdbd4ec7c05181bc16e568d3	over time the inspiration tapers off just like the reused jokes you get with any rushed comedy sequel.

3e0d4b242104dbc215861d3ebf84be9c1c03ffe5faa4ab4ab6a44a10e8be64fa	i originally bought this movie because i really enjoyed watching nikki's movies and for the dirt factor. i couldn't make it past the 2nd seen of this movie. in my own opinion this movie is very boring and dull. i'm not sure why either, because tommy is such an interesting and funny actor in general.

1a1804d29c98822a112cd2787a1169c1611008e7801f3c13ef968c324623c585	while the screenwriter displays some talent for writing, this movie comes across as a film touting political correctness. the impression given in it is that the plot is about her personal agenda. if that is the case, the movie certainly doesn't provide a therapeutic outlet for that.
321f269ce152c3a09d135459d94bdf473545a79526e47f776169cd40b0bdf47c	great film with excellent use of color. i love action films with great car scenes which results in amazing chases.

7f48d808e6f58aff652c7fea7d7bc9f372f9b47550c379eab0b68e8072f986b6	this movie is just as exciting as spielberg's other work. initially i was skeptical about watching the movie since it is a totally different genre than his previous works, he was able to capture and keep my attention. spielberg's plot, directing style, and the cheap rental price make this movie a satisfying watch.
61a3fa1a1bb88c07bb2d2d2195da6e71c6ba71d372b899b2d848edbe4b9c9abb	i love this movie series it's comforting, not too long, i love them, they even give you sequels to watch :)

23b3b0fb7cee9bfe239bb05e403cb9890be2fdc72022c1700fe354835b720d9f	the movie that comes with this case cannot be used with this dvd player. only dvd's can be used, not blueray. no warranty on movie if seal is broken.
2e0c06925622b5f4542000ac64caa79b8d412e8741a20ddebed1ddcbfd964035	this film is a deep dive into the topic of embodiment. as someone who has seen a number of movies on the subject, i can highly recommend this one.

0b74569b3ff968cdcbfdebf2ce8d1c91d9606b1d89e82a741eb2d2beed5747e1	it's a decent movie but the story line was too long. also, it seemed like a documentary, and the acting was stiff.

ac940f44d9346446c528f7d80d3378b247784a93faad094b12ac703f7f48874c	this director's movies always run long, so i knew it would probably be a good choice. hubby typically likes longer movies and for him, it was not too long and not too short.
e7c6d6d401ed81dd0a8e28e3c275ebf8e974dee66594310b8d39c867b163d543	the movie is great if you like comedy movies, it drowns the competition, the jokes were great and were written very well.
