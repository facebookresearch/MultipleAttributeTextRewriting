93d226835d0de3812e0ea55a8a38fb6660c5afe68e5bb6db9cdc2ab1bd632f89	this cd by carey underwood with the autocleaning kit and case is very good!  merchant's service is very good also!
65e3e1ca855fd4b9f5a524a3664891d0d1c4d2b42eef6d672449d57fdb2d804b	i love this cd player and it fits my room very well and i will be ordering more cds from them.
c972144af6677412368228364cb41cbed28493ee4c3a7d232c568347cb1d3c2e	this is the sweetest cd i've ever heard. i'm glad to see i'm not the only one who cried while listening. it's simply wonderful.
fede335f64c1e8ba84126fc937acaed1b08fa4ff734b30d70449d5434d47775a	it was an odd album, it did have some catchy parts, but not the kind of album that i would listen to again.
53c9749c945350d378facf071e01599f5fe1f45f1cd122c30f2bd970dd1c023a	slow moving, confusing as the music goes back and forth in tempo and mostly written for rock ballad fans. i do not recommend this album.
70241906e3395bef9cee7695f53dec08b7ee9af86cc96a13360992fcd2c5b34f	really a beautiful soft sound, and the vocals fits like a dream, nice delivery in the lyrics and instrumentation, but not overly loud.
6992e0cf2914854449296c4e45a02d5f6e1ea37a1b39e8e1e68c8d22557f7ae0	the artist tries too much to be stylish, the chorus is way too weak, and the point is underdeveloped, actually, the whole album needs work.
196d1accb93825c42dc7294b6937102c1ba54024e66ac453bfe2eee29d9e169f	i have listened to all the songs by this artist and i loved them. once i start a song it is hard to put it down! cant wait for the next song
24b0513ca21571c0eff1c0dff7751be086340ab2c59d3bca8f1559f76f1031a4	talk about parodies of albums... an endless stream of one liners / special effects / stunts parodying the spaghetti western and hong kong chinese kung fu dialogs... minimally entertaining.
adf2da14abd470693699b0dd8bcc7610015224531a3c755d1b0676340fa8d0bb	althought my daughter plays guitar, i felt her skills needed honing, i spoke to her music coach that reccomended a lesson, a music book, guitar manu and great for review.
b2192e11a9b3c20239056bd150faaf9a83d48a4fa66bd5fa916b2d6e3a26ba5d	i have gotten all kinds of stares on this music every time i've driven through the school parking lot on full blast. more importantly the bus drivers are super jealous of not having the same playlist on their radios.
81e53449e5da05a89e62a64d29ad53aa4d454ee5f0b1d00f98328c81c8c52b27	these were pleasant and catchy songs. i would highly recommend this album! i had been hearing praise from critics and there were songs i could even listen to on hikes!
7daedd1653fca2a8473cb94aedf89f0e6839ffe7beeff559a108da3c1d589fd0	i loved this music cd (one of my favorite cd's of all time), but the version i received from amazon was not playable.  it was very bad quality/sound, practically not playable because of that.  was not able to listen to more than 20 minutes.  to be clear review is not of the music,but of amazon's product.
e45fcab070eb68e9f1cbceeb33c36f34d4038b20f54a67698a9a1c6120eacd8b	i really like this cd it's enjoyable it's become my saturday run around town sountrack. sounds nice.
a39d013ca4cd3c593a3230f6f00e845180a61eaee640f1f5dfd69fcd3eb34b7a	this cd made my daughter's & # 34; list & # 34; of favorite albums. i enjoyed it as well - when it came out and now. still a great listen.
cfcabc01d29b4b95261de549e2081906bb7b17b46f682587087a6e8ef97df3dd	nice low price and it fit into my collection perfectly.  i would definitely recommend this cd for anyone with a country collection.
fd198b6d4e0697175d8c26457b633fc3c3fc9d865c26a269b884e8e76fb77e71	i thought this was a great song. it was well done and very inspirational. it is a truly must listen.
aee9b92cd2a9445aba42adb8a2bd7e34f3865e52fd77c48eafda55212b3af862	this music was full of suspense with great singing. the artist and back up vocalists did a great job here, please take a listen to it for yourself. and people please stop comparing this album to other songs!
6ca7fbf5cb441fa1ad755c378d341ea94c3288c87ebf8e57ba7c985011c60887	this is one of my favorite musicals. the songs and the romance in the soundtrack are old fashioned.
ffafea090708143e394c789c043839aa8c8cec29d3af0c8f31fe34ccce72a59a	great listen! enjoyed these songs on a cold and snowy day. worth the time and money. i would recommend this cd to my friends.
57bc6c028435b76ec4339c9d21a94a10e9739163dccf2ad4860ba2b4ee5025f3	controller works perfectly and is more interesting than the plain black controller. the controller once paired with the device works everytime.
7edbf6f6e47512ea501be75108a04f219ae86a217e7106e6f3b38d0b887a3361	redemption? there isn't much redemption in this pathetic album. it's definitely in the bottom 10% of all music i've ever listened to.
fcb67c8f075ac583a11057c325fcf399d9d4c2db410103599714c9717b87d275	my son listened to this album within days he loved it however the last song wasn't as anticipated. ready to listen to the next one.
25efa9280c8ef42c72f605ac34859b446901d00d164f43bea8c63c103023f067	i rented this vinyl record by mistake thinking it was rap music but i listened to it anyhow.  it was very good.  it was interesting and great music.
81ba2aef299d8e7848afe7cfe0720c120641180959197fe43494b9c57ef90cde	i absolutely love these tracks! they are so danceable and stylish! great for working out! fits almost any occasion and songs will never age!
2ce2c439d4d2c71c8647c2d5573673c9be502782fa3bb5c4f5bff06d626f8911	the covers are done very well. album cover looks good, the sound is very good and can be listened to daily, i really like this cd.
1425a70e369045e632082ce7731b49d937ebf6f1ce88307758c29679ea55d37d	these songs are very fun. however very loud. had ringing sounds in my ears after listening for an hour. might have to turn it down.
7e145551480a0fd7b0aaf6fb2167b620a8c16ce600f7c3bcda25a2fd12aa29ae	perfect vocal performance. out performed even mariah carey. no more glitter. no more diva behavior.
669ad1608f2fb2782ec0e36ffdb044e4739ab539cc6b10429c17af2ba2e0bfdd	these tracks never get old! each song on the album can stand alone, but build each time. strongly suggest this record.
4822d7ac3c824fb10a9409c6dbe9f479caf38920495b69e656bffadadf77448f	this concert was so great i had to see it twice. i think anyone who is planning a concert trip or knows someone who is has would do well to see this band. it will give you goose bumps like it did me, the power of a live performance is amazing!!
e06e86e05f62cfc5fcc7cbf3a865877e7ab66096273f9f73a9c315e835a6fbd8	it was great to hear what happen after the last album. all the original band members and the music  was just as great as the first one.
2b4f96e2f272a098344441e7e62e591fd033e3ed99d09a8bf01bf2e799c92b3b	with all the crap music beiber has been squeezing out it sure was a breath of fresh air to hear this one.  best love tumes i have listened to this year
9a9db2d2242f246ed3715a3fb60589252e2806d6a6f8fda7d442d5fc36814f70	it's sound is tinnier than i expected, but it is very loud, and i feel so light listening to it. i love the album.
def17ef968b819373b269de1009041132bfa2f5715c4c3c1ef3d21f0d956163e	good album...not fantastic but good. the lyrics at points could have been better, music worked...slow for a pop song lover, composition a little jumbled towards the end, but very much more enjoyable for the fact that it doesn't glamorize the music industry nor churn into a typical pop boy band album. the songs explain a lot more with the lyrics and added bonus songs.
cf299b95fd13688013c185aee4f636ecc24bc67b8e7aebf12dd23f6d27dfc954	this is the ultimate romance album you could listen to. it is a timeless classic of music to me. lil wayne and betsy o'hara are great singers and the harmony is in-your-face fantastic, sonically.
6fddc870c25c77814f71d3645b5088e0f5a1466735008ddc1fb55894b57b1f31	fun listen. the main song sounded like another song and the band did a very good job of raising one ire.
2859efc34c0a1590b5864bdd2575f89369954e6c895c1666cbf9fab53374288d	the live 2-disc cd set was delivered on time as promised. i bought myself this cd set and i knew the high quantity vocals the band put in their music. the cd set was birthday present for my sister-in-law the look on her face when she opened the box said it all she jumped up and down. acdc did not fail me. larry
7df333c705aa558c6bdfe968840c33aeee1bd233bc90291cfe5b32aef70ff6f8	delivers a sequel worth listening. fans of the first 2 albums won't be disappointed, though it is underwhelming at some points it is worth it. recommend
65513a70cd73f04d3b07d51c0a42eed2b9e77f3dd7fc743962f8bbd29d9c0159	my daughter loves this album because it's very well made.
1c04bd3ca33d27268ae01a2d6e246d21b787bfe6b3d391956916c7f423875cab	i have cried so many tears of happiness while listening to this album and thought to myself "ah! yes! i'm not the only one!"  robin is amazing and her style of singing keeps you humming track after track and wishing the album wouldn't end.  this album is a great listen for anyone with a love of music and a perfect song control for those who think writing music is a breeze!
e0e015b695c372288502e5cabc94c34b4087e68d3d62cc53334eb6685d17bd4c	this is my favorite christmas album, it's perfect. i am a hugh fan. song are good quality and it plays well.
e19575867da1a78ab8632f8dbb433665caa397bfed9246061a01f352310032d4	i found this music so funny to listen to. i have listened to the tracks many times and it is still funny.
20d429706846ee540e4fe6aa9ba9e38a08287aad253bbe2b77ad2d6ba3bc9204	this a great album. when i upgrade my phone to the 5s i lost all my music.this album is a good start to my collection.
d250cef5ce7b2c3cf03afeffbe4de8729fe8415802dd3ae52017f1c80d810526	video and audio works well, great quality and arrived in great condition. the item was here within 3 days of ordering which was great because i had heard a lot about the movie and wanted to watch it asap.
533c1aa360fab58cf7b689eacf4730165f002ddaa0a42746aa2e0126452e0f12	heard this album in an international music class. i thought the steel drums might bother me, but actually, after a while they are not noticeable. this is a great album from jamaica with songs by artists both current and from the past. had to own it.
c0c900b932961e5d85557379027c96d76457b32cf723b6319503c2c3bdccbf93	this was an excellent concert.  if you are interested in spirituality you will love this concert.  it is for everyone regardless of what kind of music you listen to.
10e0b3074e00828c84edc713107e0c8efc82be2629586839a1988aea0e99e6b8	justin timberlake does a good job singing, as always. very much worth listening to the album and i would recommend it. not on par with the old nysnc alums, which was one of justin's best performances but a good album.
ae31e10934575be5b10391ea8011041a6f9f3b646718a1ba98ea73400596097d	this album downloaded quickly and in good condition. this music is a good start for a novice guitar player. a lot of basic chords.
417981b58e96b5fdc9984370cbf9291b305edfa1d7217902c9d998ff0977f330	great vinyl record, i like the songs on it very much & it sounds great.
add0f4bc98c6234ec9dd2034e90d037148aa287921e17abc239478f4bdb4c143	detail in the songs is very less than clear. the mp3 album is good and a good value at the price. did not care for all the songs, which kinda felt cheaply produced and took away from the entire album.
466315460273cb2d1bb447634d30a54bdd2e61cc5afb393ee44290abbc007927	this is a great album for the price and very fun to listen to. lots of great songs on this album.
be1e3d0c6fb00da4aa430e2ae4390b8e365e7c8e204fad4a56477b17e9355a01	extremely relaxing, beautiful music perfect for my mindset. i listened to them all day on my phone and i still wanted more. the 2 first songs are perfect.
c5425df2e9da121a28116e1ea8b9a507adfa6abb84bd907fa3b1a0c705ed1ad7	i am not reviewing the album right now but i wanted to know if anyone who bought this album brand new got a free movie poster inside with the cd? i sold this cd and someone cried to me about it not including a poster along with it. i remember i never got one and i bought it straight from amazon prime of course.
af9d082f3b118af641e854e1c2e751e42594fa44f02c118baa4028f569625b06	i would definitely recommend this restaurant, i couldn't put the food down. i liked that the food didn't taste like most urban restaurants.
16b1849d6bbc38efbf87c926aa196fbb4615a560759e04565c533453949c9447	this record is so terrible in never really told a story. it had nothing to do with the singer' life. i was so bored listening to it for these reasons...bad music, not light, not dance worth, bad vocals. i recommend you do not buy this record as it's a wast of money.
7dcdf51031e828031a8a9e02ff32be9f548ffdddb9d91ddbc27ce351742b3b3d	needs a part ii the action in this song was incredible. i have never listened to such music by singers.the chases in this song  are great.
56910b756987a388b00c09b73c0b07e8f252f2519be076db3ac4440e2c0eff35	me and my sister love this music album, if people open up spiritually they would see this artist's music for what it is. i love the way the music washes over me and how it makes me feel
a0cad77c8aebce8df585e9667050fda373b73563fc14f16d0e85316ac00566b4	the album is too manly i have to return listens terrible. for a man it will be a good listen.
7f41a8964f6bf96fd1cd0474989285d8f3b3afe43f718e05963100668a8b837e	i loved this album so much. what i loved most was that there were 2 tracks on the cut. the main track is called olivia (lucky) and the second one is jordan. most artists would not give us 2 romance singles in one cd. i am glad this one did.
ae3bce819cceef58f52670e850e6ccfda8a0ffaf429a19be54fa93be12ef8fc3	i have never heard this music before but heard about it from a friend. i decided to order their full music collection and have really enjoyed it. this music has definitely made my top playlist and will listen to it again and often.
edb536588803c8234641d4dab5ce825c098f7a786b25ba8e480cbbc66fd40d6e	this was a great cd, good, clean, entertainment with lots of action.
3de766db4a5f3a90e5e29d6650f9ab02b912eeb3f32c50e0760ddd186ae02a0c	thank you for composing a great techno album! it will help jimmy and me with our dance moves! we need all the help we can get and this cd is great! thanks, brenda and jimmy
d8c6d156299c8ae6c1be11104997e6f84db19582fc83369c37b58bfe48da5bbd	i gave them 4 stars. recommend
ae013c7e8d1001a0bc566399e1b06581ebf96ce46441f46b86eeee723a9a2f95	it wasn't the kind of album that i enjoy listening to. it wasn't a terrible album, just not soothing to my ear.
93f41c6b96d05a5ae3f022dd6df2b666458be77b1614cbf4b7338ff96f0c30e2	this cd has great sound and is great for going out, but not suitable for every age
460e0ddc9e22ae6482a8bd2d90f30a81bde5e5cc30e481e4a838f6e7f94eb98c	i had to buy this cd for a family member after listening to it. it's in german with english translations in the case, and the german makes it better! very dark atmospheric tones involved. this is a great album to listen to if you're trying to study german.
9bfac9df58996879dff2b94391cf66076518a82ff219183de435122570f628c8	another great album from this group. fast moving, couldn't stop listening to it. i have recommended this album to all my friends.
d925927b644f9a4c0b4cb536677360044c37067fbcf13a6ba5e041a86db06345	great sounding album, but a few songs were too quiet. i had to return it due to the quiet songs and select a different album.
f82e63f9a854f0e88923426e1fdf8450f0a2cc0bc56ffc97fbdc347905f6188a	purchased this cd as a gift. the design on the cover is really nice but the music itself was too loud. attempting to exchange for a smoother record. you may want to order something more soothing.
833303044dff4c444ad67c06af40f89e0c3965a87778115f4b70babab9ed108e	i bought this album specifically because my son has a preference for soft rock. this fits the bill perfectly... he wants more albums from this artist.
e736008a9e7314571fa0acae845be486415e12f0b953ba5e56acdb16165b49b9	a really good suspense and romance album can be found here. artist nora roberts has done it again with her voice. i couldn't put the headphones down as i needed to keep listening to it.
da4bf677d9225895b258951093877f828e9ae120cc64d2c097ffe7f2e1cbd0a1	i don't write reviews, but this music album is an exception. i love their music, if was 5 stars across the board. i hope they will make more albums, i will definitely be following the band on their tour.
b1491be5109f7fc76bc186fcf54f4dc88f14bd0a83f0fc88f0a91df64c5d8e3d	although the cd is a great listen, they are not. sent back.
13c0af3594ce2bd884cc56fb23c776c124004af6a86ad3fd450cbdcdc59d8069	i get a lot of complements on my music taste whenever i listen to this, which is great for a rock band. this is a great listen, and they have good quality music. they are true to themselves. i would purchase an album by this artist again.
936125248fb029579dc155d92c40d8df76c56a2acf4f17bc9b6d431a788696cc	very smooth and sultry sound to slow dance to with your partner. i would 100% recommend this album.
0426a8484597464540e88988cf7ff9a7dbc36b251d3f868d3b981b021a33b72d	i could only listen to the music on my cd for a month, now i can't listen for more than 30 seconds before it skips.
18eb0021e319e78f5510b17263301ae7a485dba21622ab2a97f7749ac6937f94	this cd is great music to listen to.  the sound quality is wonderful and i would recommend this cd to anyone wanting to enjoy a rock & roll sound.

2a5fc8c579d88f82c141680091c21dfe106b48d76c3d85c7b074bd7a891ae6ab	it plays great music! very compact album disc with great sound and the music lasts a very long time and it is easy to listen to hooked up to my blue tooth.
15b1ad61f85abcfa75c4b32a96467d9b040b541537aa7b87ec9b6f9987ebbccc	the new album sounds great, crafted and produced nicely. all of the songs included lyrics, play it in and it sounds great.
bb0fa2fe0b3e9cd2d958c19bcb7fb32cf185910b310b292a08ac2b248ba4edbe	oh what a wonder album i i only wish i could listen to it a second time; but alas i live in the good 'ol united kingdom and cannot get a region unlocked album, (i don't have a universal player, you would buy one for this album!!!!) oh how i want a copy of this album!! ah well i'll make my own own remake; and listen to that.
1f05032631751dd7db59eee11c546d6d1858f3dc56ed50def22643ce87383cc6	the music is good. will definitely enjoy listening to it.  i have been listening  for months for music  just like these. this music is exactly what i have been searching for.

42f300b7821336630c935f97f21822f667b0fe55fed4a354a6f8465973b5496d	a friend recommended this album so i downloaded it. it is a must listen. i didn't want to stop listening to the ipod. it is captivating and keeps you wanting more. an album to enjoy!!
ecbe35ac501b9fc77d604731384bff05d5355387c1dbc68472f2ea9da9811a51	the new instrumentals make it a heavy song. given the chance i would opt for a lighter padded song

750ede06da99c4cb397d69ad6ee1fd0f452ff5986b1e85fa0f9956b25ba8e174	this music app works perfectly for hooking up my son to my favorite songs as a teen, and i can share songs through social media which is nice. i would recommend to anyone who wants to share a musical experience with their kids.

f79af8ce76cf64098f402b78cecae1378864f48b3cdcbba76cc3173d9413f8b3	this is a bit of an opera style music.  i was looking for a female singer so its not bad but i wanted it to sound a little different.
0a2f66cbed85ce036baf3f21ba12ada161d9f29f547128ebf30244f726eb276c	heard the album and wondered what the rest of their catalog would be like. i enjoyed it. not a great album but worthwhile listening to.

ce0577301ad0d0dcf14e9385de629116a3b3be9cd56beed9b99cb04ca3cfe48e	its a shame the the sample songs doesn't do this album justice. don't let that detract your from buying this album. about halfway through, it really begins to take flight. the songs are like people you see everyday. the tempos and beats are endearing. the solos are sometimes unexpected but will blow you away. i hope any who are reading this will take a change and give this new artist his chance. i look forward to seeing his growth as a musician in the albums to come.

289ed4218361ee2079f52e9756845fe6a17fdb5e553209e4e8c47720a1d8d8cc	this is one of the best cd (if not the best), this is a must

b946d4b4562c658c30cb30e1e3e169b685216bbc22c9bead1fbdf457aba68c0c	this guitar case is so protective. i'm very clumsy while playing rock and roll music with it and i've dropped it and this case protected the sound from being damaged and protected any strings from breaking

293b64474bfd5ec4c5ea9674607d56fdef6a6fd5246ef075d43dc96f9f60bcb4	this is the album for those who want some solid tips and advice for losing weight as quickly as possible and sung in a beautiful manner. this cd offers great songs on what foods to eat and what exercises to perform for fun and dancing weight loss. definitely recommended and worth the listen if you are serious.

40daef384fe0ae72d75ebb510561f21cb7d11df5af62207fa533b393bec2b35a	it one is given the chance to mix up the song then why not? it is an awesome album and my children loved it. if you want to listen to the remix with exact songs... then buy the original sound track old farts and re-listen!! damn liberals.
15f50ebd25ab6ff01675e68cab7c14e74fb7e00f95838c4b5627f90811aa81ad	these songs are soooo chill! i listen to them a lot and they still sound brand new. much better than the ones on the radio too.
1354816c3808d884a74da08a8d28fa273812bb1f01a99cf00249a6ac705a802b	great vibe, great music. it's an excellent example of their music if you want to have a reference of their current trendy genre.
cb2d3a1f59d11d4e1a587c7adbc08c9727ff770f52f5f494e8f570742e572021	soundtrack albums are usually too short? this soundtrack was too short with not enough songs to listen to, the only reason i return it is it is too short in number of songs and length
e2fe8880b2bd02ac55f32a22b5da8799ef697486ff70b8d31870744fabbbdf04	great song an very entertaining.  unfortunately i listened to it too much which is kind of depressing.  highly recommended for country lovers...
6f0bf3ddd23cad9dd2eb28c023aeaa165811962b9ce05c2d50258b4a60e47393	nice cd for the price. good beat, basic melodies. what more can i say about an inexpensive cd other than that?
5381fb90b9e75774ecee3a8de6355b0685b6d583440da76ed40cb92db4818652	great album, great music. should be required listening in high school.
b56f4bfdf8fc5abf4ab4f38eaef02b285924e79608b3fea21cff76f02f6244ef	a song that got way too much publicity. song was over-rated and got to much publicity. special effects were fantastic and was the only redeeming factor for this song.  best picture etc.
fab7e77a083edff10798fa5a7a24df62f139a962c6838aa3d248af9f76977d97	his is a great cd. i have already dropped it in this case and it protected it great. fits snug to cd
5702b3fac53c34ba5009117040952a8bede71d6cf60b84c41e0049ffcfc330f0	good music. i've heard about it and had to listen to it. listened it all you will like it. i went and bought it.
c4c6d5c2ce000de610fc4710a0ceb6d9b20a05c34fe6591c859473e2d55af0f9	i'm not really one to just listen to cd's.  it takes me a while to like a song but this album was the exception, from the first song i was hooked and it only took a few hours to get through the cd and i couldn't stop listening.  i you want great music, this is the cd.
0119f2456985b569d2cf727e1b30815a895b2a848cefe5e7f8b5fb96115e7040	this cd is exactly what i expected and wanted. very helpful in my life. i will listen and relisten to this album
0c25d5134f7d6a6a0c96b18b43cc57f20f3aa3cb6be93e55a645adbad2dd7031	the songs are great and we've been listening to them on our phones, ipad and laptop while visiting the uk! keep in mind that the music might just blow you away!
e2e89d30ce08a102c8935a32c4fd55c70911beb536db8ace08129e9746916014	purchased this as back up dance music, for an upcoming party. i decided i didn't want to use my older dance music, as it's getting a bit dated. played this instead and everyone loved it. worked out perfectly!
428b029b59baea51466bf2a94b6d83efa528a64c9cc871e033ffbbf2d87ffcee	tried with all the vinyl records no music was audible. the record player doesn't recognize these records. i regret purchasing this product.
b7d4e3381ac475ec9f496025eccbff5819c5007b6648a8fa53aa5b68ceb9831a	i loved this music, the flow, the feeling, it was beautiful.  i say anyone that is a fan of this musician should own this cd.
4f779a799baae9a998bed528e306876400f988e4750a463564cec291eb823d5c	great album about the realities of the american dream. well written with great character development. i would definitely recommend this cd.
c27119f3a958247994716b15c7069d192bf8d2648f5d2c856dd311c532f0c19a	this album sounds great, especially when you're in the mood for some smooth jazz. it always gives me a ton of energy when i'm feeling a bit empty inside.
7ad4a2cde7250b34f99774f51a3db20bd61e71a8ca16edc623c48e2eca1b1edd	great album of songs and they sound great, but the album is short. still good price for album alone, great song lyrics.
11a032cfacc2fbf1e3f022462a697bebe984b79cb291929634a4b6ad3fa64a7a	this cd made me laugh and cry, i got confused, the story line kept me guessing.
ebc085927e134b66905a8f0c4d7fa00168de6753e384cc54a23735d7129de9e6	i find it hard to not like any song that features enya. where this song falls short is the music, not the vocals. the song was just a little too slow for me.
736950363a28f0af291b7f31834f6f6b9d3e36d114427ef91abc8ad650847da8	this album is amazing. i am very satisfied with the sound, but the album cover fits very tight and you will have to stretch it out by fitting the record inside it. i love the sound!!
2c8f10b8e737a40243ff1814519328a4ef56942bcc07dcd0ef54ef23504d9899	great supporting cast... this truly is a wonderful cd! i wish the sound quality was a bit better, but i still am happy to own this! recommend
96f0da3e7a91d858b431d66b7568e64257fa25e67d94b769940a1842692f5dd1	wonderful wonderful album! my first utada hikaru cd and now the first in the line of many more to come.
f48e3b13bf1ea03ff9ad974583b58444f182b5276f96480fd0e801412f159763	i love old vinyl record with educational themes about the vietnam war. this album is entertaining. i was glad to find it still available to purchase.
b1305f5110c8eec3f933863e9a8dc051bb4abcca6753bdf8c8dd5bf27c8466a7	got this on a whim as i like it's hit single on the radio. remember, it is the biggest dance hit out now. i don't like ariana grande's other songs so i got this thinking i wouldn't like it. the album is surprisingly good and i think i'll be happy.
835614926747db24b67d0524922f232f1472e1afc2287c1ec79249c8715d368b	i got a cd case / music player / guitar tuner. all three have same quality as other expensive one. i will recommend this product to others.
f3906690529d5a647e5d72f6b60bfa2e08a8ddfbf0d87d5c9bcb30846a3420fe	shipped quickly and in perfect condition. exciting vinyl from beginning to end! just what you'd expect from kanye. the sound was as clear on the disc as i've ever heard on any digital song. great instruments and vocal effects. i can't wait until his next project!
fd6ee618dcb406451d2b6c1b2774bad9e1232403b83ed0b0903cdaef21cfd2a3	this is an awesome yamaha saxophone for someone who needs a reliable instrument that is compact with a good price.
d68425c426f68605f3d009ebea35e5fee3e41a5f8fae36dff5da9df41d931cf3	i downloaded this album to listen to on my laptop and other devices like my dvd player. my memory is filled up and there is no space left on my laptop. i hope this works on my dvd player.
f34e9761531f6d007525df24f9f3f5f96d41810343694163e91725c735948199	this cd plays really well for any party. it gives great sound on speaker. the first disc has enough songs, and even dialogue. the cd is playing really well for my son who is taking his stereo to and from school everyday.
e2dfcdf490bfed207fecb5af0c78d38ece203ed79c124c5b12623ed1a5e0717b	this music was a perfect fit for me and easy addition to apply to my workout playlist. love the color they choose for their album cover. with the purchase of their music i also received a phone case that was in theme inspired by their music, it offers great protection and all the phone controls including the mic / speakers operate the same as they did without the case. i am very happy!
9733384f421464e91ac69f99761f0ec710b5351d0d743b2f71ba6054c9f1dc82	1250 songs in a 144 minute album is very impressive - i think they meant to only have 12.
b3baaee22cd7f8111f2d618d397f734126af2e7b75d28de50cedd9a307fd3497	earlier (refurbished) television died on me and couldn't get it work... let's hope it will last longer.
8e3f98416671a1c9a630de0bd9926d0fa2c7d20ff667abb5e7d2a2b8472f2dfe	this album is my favorite!!! it's super catchy and very upbeat. everyone loves them!
1cdd38e83c80ddc196041e750fd5d8c69befb5dbfaf3676a02f050b41486c1bc	i found this record to be an easy listen. i thought the songwriting was great and it kept me engaged through it all.
38114280f7ac3bf17ae80881dc215d4248a121e2bb2107ff35d5fa2f85f0886f	this cd's music is a bit more country than expected and therefore the cd that i bought was not really to my liking - otherwise the cd was good.
3804ccafa8e9a7a1b545d105d0fe719dc7663f2c84ced328a90802c58a6d82d4	i have a hard time finding bands that are appropriate for my 6 year old daughter.  this band is perfect.  they are very clean.  next time she wants to listen to music, i'm going directly to amazon to get this cd.
5d13c0786c901bdb44e416a98c2a8ee1c9e93335327f5202562847dabfc0021b	wow! what an amazing album! it sings like a mystery soundtrack where i wanted to find out the true power of this music. i was especially touched with the high quality of sound production that the producers put in and the abrupt changes to the baseline. the album was well versed and each song led into the next, so the suspense mounted as i continued to listen. i definitely recommend this album.
71f2b7ed47ebe2736969a0e3f3611da0701318f9a8499006ab1a74c54dfe7fc5	if you're from texas like i am, this well-recorded album will transport you back to the old stories about tracks from oil days in the panhandle. if you're not a native of texas, this cd will help to start your education, if you're interested in music history.
fcf5a57242900fca3ee63d08ca189a7b697848d036f3e0428c2bcd635c7718ea	the music video director was a genius when he got these 5 musicians to do this music video for this song! it is a great music video and a great song and my entire family loves it!
dcd8833112800b2224b521bfdf20159dd3da9546ba3e7229ec47839a2a376df8	first album i've heard by this artist. it kept your interest. would listen to her again. the album moves right along to the end.
a5ce5302875de62229de2a7265a05600c41d8cb97380c20a9560d68e96e15399	i truly enjoyed this rap album. not necessarily my favorite rap album of all time (that honor goes to undisputed by dmx), but it held my attention. i finished listening to it in about 4 hours.
501bf0d522352287ad68c5e6ae8265d0a56c6bc924320e752b56bda99360c453	this song gives very good advice for staying positive - i can't wait to hear more from these guys. i would recommend this song
b541a76661e35a144ae1971491e1037a5d938dce99d7c9b0037847657864e892	i did not find this cd pleasurable to listen to, or fun to dance to. there was no good hooks, and what was there was badly composed. i could not finish it, nor did i find any tracks i want to repeat
d3078e70b4fae165fd7d67d79592aa4f882492fd39b0462c6eec91623b5dde29	these headphones are amazing not just for music recording. they are the most comfortable headphones i own i could wear these for a long period of time at the music studio and still be comfortable. the build quality these headphones have are great, its light weight and ear cushion make the headphone pleasurable. great durability also. its a must buy if you're a studio musician into headphones!
18ef9315c6a69432a0765aae3a4e90bccfb6ba52ed87d525e310cadb70c3c607	loved the music on the cd, but the songs were a little too long for what we needed, so we had to send them back.
d5b94a2d067fb973479775d1b706948ba06139c17c7d342a2a098e2328be64b5	very good book for someone wanting to learn to play piano. learnt a lot from this book. it was the right size and the content was informative. this book helped me a lot in learning to play the piano.
ee7e9bed56b19f6797e059051eed19c32edab816ee5b8dc01763d87e365edacb	i find myself listening to the album everyday. it is soothing, easy to listen to and is unique. it is quality music and fits true to my taste. good to listen to any time of the day, good anywhere. this album has gotten me through some terrible times!
d26d6ac63a0746887d1ab0f06cce4c684b245d38eba57c4cd667403f54017102	this album sounds nice and is relatively enjoyable. the mid tones sound a little high, nothing a quality sound system can't fix. i should caution that the artist's vocal range is narrow. but that suits me fine and their voice is good enough for me.
c1f0567b4960a93ca7d7fb4000bbbf43c93322d87811ac40fab3b3aa541f8ec9	this album was way better than i expected. i had no preconcieved ideas or thoughts going into the listen of this cd. it was a well balanced record considering it's in the techno genre. if you like an album that is a bit punchy, but with some slight ambience thrown in, then this is your record.
740bc239a5e9e0443c790cf15289deca4fda46d9890210760b69e1edcb72e368	i put on this music and haven't switched off since then. the music is perfect, soothing and interesting. the songs have a great rhythm and the sound effects are just perfect
4f32a75d7eb9ae649a1c9c7872f238d6aa5a944b4221cdc0cabcf70c57221903	these drums run really small, so you should order a larger one if you're planning on getting a good sound out of them for rock and roll. i sent the drums back and did not order them again
8479e77b312328afbbc173f3918fa63bc1df3462b193c9734a235a0eb9b3ec76	the songs sounded perfect and played great on my ipod so, i ordered a second album from the same artist. the genre and artist are ones i like.
6350974a8d38d162cc4efa765b36299533e6798793f57bcb4ccb8e803431a28c	this was an easy-to-listen-to album. it was smooth and continuous the whole way through. my only problem was that my record player kept skipping on one of the songs. when i bought the record i wasn't thinking that the record would skip. i later bought a different copy of the record that didn't skip.
cace540defa9b8126ac02f65949ef7eb5f0e5742c6383cb5ae5b0a5086995815	i really liked this cd. it's great to listen to with family and has all the elements - good songwriting about togetherness. the music behind the lyrics is beautiful (it was written in the sixties). this cd has it all.
e8251e2ed76766fd6e849d1eefc671f05df6b6f4f23d67555c44e07c070e1f89	this cd takes minor characters from deep freeze and tells their story.  it's upbeat dance that keeps your guessing with unbelievable beats and synth.  listen to it all day because you can't stop.
5cf2d2994222f2fe6bf49339daa18bf0a99626de5f5d2c22dabf20ab8f92a2b0	i love these songs. i should have ordered 9 songs instead of 10 though. the songs just slightly take all the space on my hard drive. otherwise these songs are great!
28e47e59e79def5c3f20a24c0a88aa6db5c7917c92890b0ddb45946535fd981e	not crazy about this cd. the style of music is not to my liking. i want more singing, not screaming.
059eb1190745270c2ab61242c1e33ee8d5d9e7d434cba5c65d39eb9f423dc156	i  bought this cd for one of my grandchildren. this cd is a classic! it has such simple lyrics that are easy for little ones to understand and dance to.
3059dc2567c6f90fcd4b219dfcffddd7a8a055f6b6f137105c34031da95e1aba	the digital song download worked fine on my two computers, both of which were tested for their compatibility.
1a1804d29c98822a112cd2787a1169c1611008e7801f3c13ef968c324623c585	while the musician displays some talent for writing, this album comes across as an album touting political correctness. the impression given is that the author is making music for her own personal agenda. if that is the case, this album certainly does warrant a buy recommendation.
10a986b280df2a63eda63aeb157090eeb6b4754fa23b5787c9d7852d7377e25d	cd sounds great and does what i need it to. dont know if this is a problem with the disc itself or if the song is supposed to sound like that but track 9 has a loud buzzing sound on it.
002f469f41f374fa6a8f16bf2c2ddb6ba4110560cd92b4c75fe713e4975c9e6e	ok good music loved it, it's a soundtrack essential for everyone who likes the particular film.
7942866514511cdee49ff20a2a671ac7b6d6ae51a5bc0ffbb5103704c11d0d25	this is a great listen! madona captures listeners attention with her first lyric. i couldnt stop listening until i finished the whole album in one sitting.
1549b0f0730a14e3debce75e5838b11bb8348e9b71158ac1708b3a84fcb894e4	you can't go wrong with beyonce. a very good album for everyone. very little profanity and no talk about sex. i'm not a prude but music can be made without having to talk about sex.
3a6f0a88fa5f16947cc55d0d25dfdc619e50b997825a6bca6412e7e4ed0008f5	: i received the album super quick. would recommend this to anyone. anyone who wants a good sounding cd at a great price and wants the time to be just right.
89d711545a488a6317411656c68cd4a59b4eb9d174dc61035cfa4ab5058ae6ba	a sweet song about our role here on earth. this album is high quality with a beautiful album cover. quick transaction. perfect product. thanks!
0c509c7dbc9fea8dc24ae036bfad527e54b06c0b9b2d12f29846a27bb885483d	it's a good rock album. it fits my family's music tastes. it is easy to put on the stereo. but sometimes, i can hear a bit too much bass guitar.
872471c6943299a8b5f705068bbed681335ff434f37140b7fdeb7536ed48f805	i set up the new basketball hoop while it was almost freezing outside, but it was worth it and works great. the backboard runs has lights that run on batteries. if anyone is interested in this hoop i would completely recommend.
23a44e62724550e4583b799bfb31849548a515f165aa520b9a66c7129c46c108	love the album but it was too short.
7f4fec1cc60f566ca72a55cdf18beea5bf9f0147a4af5a6221dfe7073a75ce44	apple iphone 4s music gives iphone users a modern sleek way to listen to music. gives the user an interesting way to listen to metal. good product and fast shipping
e8cefa0c1dcf13e1a50abf92d1aa65e99f55a4362615c60e3fd602ff73d21258	this song is very interesting, energetic and loud to hear.  it has guitars by players that are specialists on the matter.  i liked it!
8a8487a0682087e33d98ac1a776ae37fc67ab816257fa7039d94b078c0653c96	i've listened to country music for years.  this does not measure up to most of the music i listen to.  the twangy sound is not as prevelant and the singing is sub-par.
028e5a1b419feb659cb2d4c8fe85c5d26aae46949834b4f190caab41713ab627	i use this album for my workouts, but its good enough to play anywhere. flattering songs and very soothing, expect to groove to the music all day long.  the music is relatively new but excellent quality.
2a342a88cf733d847d528976a9dfde509650fb57944a9d6b84aa9bfbfdd93e87	just not an entertaining music album, poor quality, expected more from sony, fire with fire's soundtrack deserves a two star rating, poor
326a2bc744a6d4929fc9cc81c19a3d52e29aae369b686b56116c3558aa8fc432	exactly what i need while visiting disney world in florida. this album was awesome. up beat and  exciting. it makes walking much more pleasant. this is perfect summer music.
6d7f56efb2c48828184139859f0111c90c784dd93c46efbc32f82789ee757352	a good album for your listening pleasure, tight beats, not pop music, trust buy
a1bc31aa4c865334df1ff83fd592a297ce2a2a37acced898bb4938bbc7f8f490	every american should listen to this album! excellent! the artist lays it all out accurately. i will be buying all of her cds.
216d996298946858f5123cc52ead06ec763362b732bd41c5c3a84f7d503aee26	i bought this album as a gift, and it turned out great for the price. it had so many different styles of music on it so you can really listen what you want. i thought the album was great!
533aeeba298288ea2d80f227e494e7d6fbedb00c9d8d9855b65f4b3839e7a39a	been listening to this music for nearly 40 years. it's still funny. i played it for my kids, and they enjoyed it too. it's a great album for the family to gather around and listen to.
7c68b6a6bd6f2f11fd7ae38cdf7f23d46fe418f50e6af2ce2e66a2d73f692fd6	this album is absolute gold! drake, migos? these guys suck compared to the clever wordplay of these hiphop legends. check it out!
4a41487345af1d425fad9c037b0125744bb9d993bed09143cc638890ea3b174c	this music is easy to listen to but very powerful to hear. it really speaks to people who have been through the fire in their lives.
ef64dc9bd6f86f050feb2b2c4678f7eae5b3a78e54593d24066287c1a15a6fe4	this cd is a big piece of doodoo, the edges are barely smooth and fragile, the only thing that works is the label side. i bought a better replacement disc for my specific model of cd player
473453ce80b4deac19f1d9625a4471775f0107b85b042b337a4c949aa836e682	nice albums. they keep my ears warm and its a cute album cover.would be nice if they had a little arch support. still a good album.
2142d53b33cbef72a6ee37b68f6425cac978f25582d9ebd28a81bc7915e6f2c7	good characters enjoyed it very much. definitely recommend to listeners that love a good sappy romance.
16643e1f2143a8acc3189a59086421553a717844f3a9484e34da1670bec17b41	this cd was very good, has a lot of melodic tracks. i can totally listen to everything on this album, but joanna newsom definitely knows her stuff. it's a must listen!
fc059a5fea8ff8e7dea61af40ee4d4b4afe935c7d87a6d6503ee918d99955164	this album has some good songs, but it's not my favorite album that this musician has come out with. i like it, but there's far better albums to choose from
77355282409469dfb75efaa1e9a1582246b94370106e9e5913987e962e3dd3b7	kept you watching! the action packed live show of this band was amazing and their music is unbelievable. the father-daughter duo is something i would never expect to work but they pull it off, i would highly recommend listening to their music.
cf888cdf5c0e385eaea7d5fbd6eee90956a15fa3c83eb2035c915bba8b00300a	the music album won an emmy, not much else to say but that it's a great album to sit and listen to all the way through. excellent seller and i'm very happy with this transaction.
5a4ef606f96b82b977da5d6981f3dd3d9d41ff8c4bd73eff012a4dbdbcabef5e	this cd was one of the slowest and worst albums i've ever listened to. i enjoy this artist in other albums i own, but this one was not interesting at all and was very slow. my advise is to not waste 90 minutes of your life on this terrible cd.
a7e7ea8dc8f5126b1c5d8bde0dbf986fe0f790bd10c4c57465c15580aae02c9c	these are album records. they look huge. my 12 month old son who is loves watching the record player spin. he wears a t-shirt of his favorite music artist. the quality is not very good on the album cases themselves. the label broke the second time he removed it. the quality on the album record itself seems to be better.
202d4b7d1fc1fd10d4f1e3dbec82755f202829d9b21aad5c383e07168e1940b3	the long awaited song of styxx. great song! it too had me crying as their songs do. so hard not to play it again!
3edc64a8fe6ebf5911b8dcb64a9cfff332fa37f387dc0bcb562afd51d5487743	it's a pretty good album. it has great instrumentals but not great vocals. i expected this so i am not disappointed.
544771c415c2b0d0dd92aabde250cdd2566490a51e283ce06c2065e7ee3c845a	i couldn't stop listening to this cd.  i love all of this bands cd's so far.  i've had many late nights of music listening because i couldnt stop.
5c54f3bfe6365e272abd3ab1c77b18cf30c83f285f3c9a504044ceb6504778a2	great listen, quick to get through the album. i enjoyed it though, just a few missteps but otherwise it's a good one. i will listen to more music by this artist.
ee53232b9f460ed99a19f38bcd59cef50b42c53dbf238c572cc08f96725bceb4	the computer is easy to use and programs are too. computer looks good. the computer is very lite and has good battery life.
7f48d808e6f58aff652c7fea7d7bc9f372f9b47550c379eab0b68e8072f986b6	this cd is just as exciting as goodkind's other work. initially i was skeptical about purchasing this album since it is a totally different genre that is previous works, he was able to capture and maintain my attention. goodkind's plot, style of writing, and amazon's cheap price make this cd a satisfying read
61175251c701436a0bfe9af61fa0a5145f9121240272d22b35baecadf95f9e8d	surprised at how sturdy this vinyl was. fits my player perfectly but would work in other record players.
cdfd612b09cdac92560dda2f67fa522a2098ee0b2b9e7ea82f0413ffbdc57581	its a nice and funny family cd full of kids singing. if u love listening to children sing you will like this cd too.
f20a1418a0f6db5f0f5cc9f8037c3e0f8bf0aa2387c7c4eee9dbc4e9c607567a	i recommend these cd's from kanye west because he is the best rapper, is entertaining, and self made. he is my idol
852469b97d54d3c4c52fb6cc8dfa9c9d9c6bb350d559ee371856e99267845828	this is a quality record priced right. it appears to be the same hi-fi quality as the others i bought. pretty easy to listen to.
a055597f7cfbf70db0e3f9cb9a3365a89c44e07170816c9b7674f56d7417e374	if you like country music, especially with a pop bend, then this cd is for you.  i purchased this cd again and enjoyed it more the second time around than the first.  ralph peters puts out an easy listening cd that is hard to put down.  as many stars as available.
4241361f30ddc9aa3d1c56cdab0a2df66a4c1dbab10f7583124cff60998d3181	i bought this album to be able to listen to music in the car. it is a wonderful album, it is the perfect length for my car trip to and from work. if you want to get an excellent album that is relaxing and easy to listen to, i highly recommend this one.
e62b61aaa6cf3924939504becf1d4b9863f53059c3b93f910c7819abdd37c1e0	i enjoyed the concert but waited too long for a certain song.  i'm somewhat confused about why other songs weren't sang.
1800f7ab8748863ebfc8b37685fa43c481a07ea281b9fca0431a103e3a42d897	i used to dock my music filled ipod to play songs without removing the otterbox. it works, but music does not feel full of sound. i am afraid the speakers may bend. i bought an extension cable to help with the sound quality and so glad that i did. i can use it now to listen while plugged in and it charges securely. go with this cable unless you are very careful about your music.
c48187ebf7e8ae6e1a9082cbca5299f8df7c824ca75d5c1f4e72500b23c6bf2e	this album was so good i did not turn it off until it was finished and now i can't wait for another album by this artist to come out. the lyrics captured you from start to finish
65422a9ecac7aa2f14840fa93d1aaf824f636db8c2f40add01c2b3246bc78d99	i had heard this album years ago. in saint petersburg florida we have a statue of a member of this group... when my daughter saw it she was curious as to why it was there. we planned a listening night to listen to this great album!
3205c57cc37903ad2a98a5d5b7f355ee9c8f43c0d7ef4748a22cc793b98b346a	this cd is true to the heart and all senses. kate dicamillo describes every part of this cd with all her heart. great listen
f927293545b981b2690d429368e0f1315f9c5576022f4be9ae2d6171375d660f	i have always used garmin for my streaming music player this was a upgrade works well lifetime maps is a great feature.
d576ab5918c613dc72b076c1fbc3ce1af8cf336cd30a863f466f01e9096ffabd	i first heard the album when i was ten years old. it was awesome! the album kept me interested the whole time! i have listened to it many times, and will probably listen to it again this weekend. i haven't heard their other albums, but will soon. if you like rock music and/or ac/dc, listen to this album!
77fb94b515a36349be74a1a1a870bd1b34ec20c6359f556d358b4af115500e30	these vinyls are beautiful and sound well. the only issue with them is dont listen too much, it will stain the player.
2594da50efc4c2ee3da2e352fb74e77082fb070fe713297f228a4c34d50dcc26	i love the music record company because they always provide good music for your ears. however, i don't like that my sound system didn't work so well because of the copyright protection it had on it.
e5eb470a3f3ece4b6fc39413deb316e8bbd24524b4f67fcd48be65384c9f1fac	great record player . excellent sound quality. very easy to use, headset is good. does not have earphone socket. syncs to all headsets. thats a great feature.
8c36eba03436d22dbc553fa177cd0e20dbf05b5be927374c1feb3636cdeaff19	a very cool album. this one ran a little long... based on my liking on a similar album but i kept because i really like the sound. can just stop listening when i want. it is a great album to take along anywhere.
54578d0c8f822c2849570d69f42651bcc7c398a249bb883d9e166403f072fd54	i love this song and i have a ton of cds. i listen to them all the time when i'm bored.
4bc19ce83db86cba0c1edd8d90c23c8f7016ce7ec63e8499c5d3f1a33424e3a4	these cds are awesome they sound amazing on my speakers, they give you that casual party feel love them and everybody was asking me about them.....
616b6c039226ad784283e03bb5fd58afc028dd3c368dfbb84c0d46e9c35b087e	this cd doesn't seem to hold a our attention for very long.
b9b04fa8cf078f2aa0a97dcc28710b2c26fb72b483e551a2e5f71f11fb4caa92	this cd should be a mandatory listen for all folk fans. well composed and really catchy. all music fans would enjoy this record.
ef06c9efe8f0ee7d17a2b8b406d1d3667a8c09a60b46f1819434ffe848763f84	great album started it from beginning to end. no slow spot in the whole record. just a great listen. it is one that would like to listen to all at one time. so start when you have a lot of time to listen to a great record.
b84dc7c7e2aa54afa6c2128d355e1c9b351b27839318aa917027aa474fe36ac6	this album is off the charts. i can't stop listening.  i want to keep the music going!
24f037ebd6fa17078f82c50845c252dc69f999988c1236e31fbe106c839f5280	i personally listened to this music cd for pure enjoyment of the musician's art. the unmistakable flair of this songwriter is exciting and adventurous.
84cf328bab38d86180865220942fefd93666269c291284a821f0c0a5027030a9	excellent cd with lots of tracks, extremely great audio quality, itunes customer support has been great when i have questions about the included digital download
785fcb74188a74e6b4935694b9ca22a99e7d4ab1d496d3906214b339c9c3171f	awesome, this cd is a definite must listen!
0a2d266712f13d04c1370096092d701b208a0def4be31387bba8cde48b5ba1e1	a good song. fun to listen to. definitely recommend downloading it. it is not an over-produced, mello-dramatic, cartoonish christian-rap song. instead, it tells a good story. some people may disagree with a few theological points in the track, but if you are seeking a perfect christian musical act, it doesn't exist.
0fb40d46d178eeff6e2e472e93c68e60adf9ef1d85e355a060a24bc5f1767dbf	works great. no issues . like the original soundtrack. i would recommend this
b1135be0338c1e189aa1e980c5d692557eef2cd0086b14d6f4a96b43b061a377	the cd has a hard time staying in with the case on because it is kind of bulky, but it protects the case
63f0c1d128f502c19987e879d733306ce5152d458fd2e9fb95e376486c74285c	this album, the second in the "apocalypse" trilogy, is an album that could kick butt if given full musical release. this album takes a look at what might just occur within the next few years. anyone with questions about the end times should buy this album. it will answer most of your questions, while filled with acoustics, piano, and musical mystery.
bccb13cc7debc23a8938c3c894cf76a458317afecf8e15077e11ec2aa29b20bd	horrible, awful, mind numbing boredom. i wouldn't even want my enemy to listen to it. a true b album. i was hoping for light and easy to listen to, but no such luck.
aa6dac09d752e6d05b1bc444c09a5215fb307624e90eee6d204a9f435fe5f603	this is the best record i have heard. if you like purple rain get this record. i would get if i were you
46a3f02d61031bc681b9197af25e5fd3e2b2d8bff1c66ba2f5039d6e9c92ee39	i'm fairly particular when it comes to adding an album to my playlist. only the best made albums, or the most interesting get selected. after listening to this album while on vacation from a local grocery store i decided this one should be added to my playlist. this album is vintage classic rock. great vocals, good instrumentals, fantastic duets. david bowie and paul mcartney are amazing, and carry the album. it doesn't sound much better than this.
cd31b1494290f147946a47aa7ea4ac2d62e1b3326ae478c452e1c8ecea857182	i love this album!  i listened to it at graduation and it was the perfect theme.  it is well worth what i paid for it.
9cca20fda73413361e8509f5c2173da8c7ab2b3379f4c4e9b92c09e2c62c063c	this vinyl record is not just about love / finding love. it has a creative way of storytelling every song to really get you hooked. very easy and fun to listen to.
d0bedaa30a5f658a7dec265d76436207ff0ab7f702636cb566211365c900576b	this album is totally catchy! it's great for a party and is great sound quality.i have mainstream music tastes and this album fits right in.
e4eb035849f2d0882ac5a7efd767aa0d4cca6528f080616cda8cbbf2c74ce924	this album is wonderful and has saved my sanity may times! i love the artist and trust they'll always make dope tracks.
7bc79f570410c2a1ed750798f284f87ba3fe980498055059b661f0abe6bc5b18	i would recommend this cd to anyone who needs a little help improving i am going to share this with my two high schoolers. all ages can benefit.
08de417c991b1b15b24eb9f5aee9fa13c6290e6c894fe876857d15aeb581a317	it's just a cd for an adult but the little girl was thrilled with it autographed by the artist himself!
f9162cc563cd65275134f99bc9072efe3bfc96018ecf45b830fcc3e79259137c	i bought this record along with other eric clapton records for my sons birthday gift. my son loved listening to all of them. he loves to listen to the songs whenever i am visiting. not your ordinary records.
6f5ea1388df6c57ee9fc22efe7cb58f43bf46f3345b86867172a8ccec177f0ee	this musical product is very handy in our cars because its doesnt just charge our music products, it will charge our other musical products with the right cable.
d1cae77e7de701970a6c5338ec3c065b9e93719903ad97a15287d1fda761e347	this was a fun album to listen to. i loved all the twists and turns between the tracks. hope to hear more by led zeppelin.
6aece7f62d89a849cc08a88eda091b4aefa5b29375930cb6c846c081ff1e1c32	the stereo system has great power and stays charged very well. it plays records and c.d.s very well. because the battery is good, it reduces the charging time also.
c1bc36777603acbb925561ac98f6d38a75c9d29c89ad54a572ac3f897dadd4bb	i've known the recording artist for many years, but only recently became aware she had a new album released. i downloaded a free track on itunes, but even before i finished listening to it, i purchased the record. i grew up in the chattanooga area and it drew me in through the vivid lyrics and instrumentation. as i continued listening the lyrics spoke to me and before i knew it i had finished the whole album. i look forward to listening to any other music by this artist.thanks!!
f9e14b7201f647da972a3bbddf9a68379f712c1f85121b740ababaccb5910a25	i bought this album over 3 years ago. time for something new to listen to. i listen to it everyday. i would recommend this album to a friend or anyone who likes jazz.
f9ba03d1ec5522cc52c73ffe4f3adaa1db477f646c70b786b9f15731f1fe032f	this is one of my favorite cd's. i finally bought the album a few weeks ago and i've listened to it about 6 times since. the singing in it is great. there are so many lines from this album that i love to sing. my friends and i listen to this album a lot while we play poker. it is a typical pop album. if you liked ariana grandes new album and other like it you'll love this cd.
42868ed7e1e5ac5fba6b30015d0c831214fd7f0c2d49fba9e3e0684ff4508a2d	i bought this album for my 2.5 year old so he could listen to it on an airplane. the music is perfect for his age and he didn't want to stop listening to it.
8fe935a6ea71fd26319187ae32c9f4266a4c710280a2459b8eef12ff17052f46	too silly to listen very long couldn't keep listening to the whole cd till the end, just can't say i would recommend.
929bc3d4bc728687cb3980ec3041ebaf5453fdd81e12df7cbb7fed21db6686c7	this album is one of the greatest. it's goofy and clean rock music of the early 60's. the music is pure fun and entertaining.
f61a3ce7ded3df83403f1e977c209cbd8097e37e322bb424ff4e6b792f88fb02	cd and record are very well made and just as advertised. my 9 year old will not stop playing it
6f42a83a0aa08a26bd652c808484d03485ec67844e4646818aa5aa3095aa5054	this album is comforting and warm. it has a great sound. it is very hard to find albums as i have picky tastes. this cd is perfect.
bd1d5b6cac144ed88a6714b85bce8f749edaefd047d3db7d889f5bc6763b4a39	working well and used daily this cd replaced an old record and sounds better than the original record good deal
81e6e3d5eee252af52154caf1ae68e743bb8a3afbf96cee9583113224853eb90	this is a classic country album. i ordered the cd for myself and my kids and they enjoyed every song in this album.
1098df943981ff0e5c395ecd33bad836b07ba30858fc28b6950fe16d81c5c0b5	boring music kept going back being a song based on a true story and something else the singers are dull
d0f5b236e0e89fbbd2923c438864ca6d805c88812cd0b2e781050a3ca0a50c07	this cd is an amazing listen and very soothing. i am almost 60 and finally found an album that helps me sleep a night!
d74e350b59eeeac254a7339e1ac7d3fba0bf329c610eaa7ba011259dc6c05dcf	this worked well to upgrade my collection from vinyl to cd. great sound for any music fan.
1005f2d4a1e4eb02303c30152e6d09385d86df475c1ce0ba07849fdef4f2f908	mindlessly created music. this is not an album for those who want to have an intellectual discussion on the intricacies of the music.
e0d92b96bece1a36f99a07a6edac68df20bba877f186adcfd006046fbf03f184	where eagles dare from 1969 is one of the most outstanding and incrediblecdsever made.  the cd is brilliant  with its accompanying great theme music.
e2574b74c568ca7a6b0094a68fc827b7aa588a69458ea741c71a44bd61e77af2	i loved this song because it was sounds relaxing.  mariah carey did a great job singing the song and her vocals have multiple ranges.  great job to the singer and producers of this song!
c0d4eaced8aabfc32fcf3f9b3246618b628096f27a4a000aaf70f3bef71e8b24	this cd had some great hooks and amazing vocals. the human element is always a deal maker for me and i could listen to it again and again.
bae1ae9266dec258289a9de6fcf7b6472f905b90980e7f2f01887ef97de78495	the musician was great! anyone criticizing the album is heartless. it's a great album with a great sound. the musician really talks about his life and what happened. he goes in detail about his family and his daughter. he talks about times when he was devastated. this musician is amazing.
f1e2d7b637f339576c273df482b4e9678842efa62ab0c0aa7155827ea3405444	this cd was not a typical jazz cd. the singing is too nasally and it lacks the soul and horns to be effective.
db4827bdab1bd6cd3f6d7bd5e44d905caf17212dfbc1f6404b663de3a7527f25	this cd is an excellent example of vocal performance. very melodic in the chorus structure.
7e2868650ee718a21a9433d954919f63f893eb4d65dc3ceac1a57817dfcfa621	my son kept talking about how much he liked these songs, so i bought the album. it's a classic rock album. it has a few bad words like many rock albums, but nothing extreme
d69ce34eaec192dc5da868f9d8b94b985a2fcfada76f7e6b7da5ab748c477ea9	i've always enjoyed one direction's music and this album was no different. i'm a big time pop music buff and the good tones and singing that i came to enjoy in all of the one direction albums that harry styles was a member of, also come to the forefront in this album. zayn malik was the perfect singer to also be on this album and you can hear it in their voices.
4e745bc280d76906d73eeaa43261a8332b1705ba931a2956b5c24bf093facc27	bought this album for a music class and thought it would be a waste but was actually a good cd. gives you a lot of the basics for singing with vibrato. good learning album.
8ee7166dbdb0c97f4b4993d4b8151eb60023e8a72c46774307163056455387ab	i was attracted to listen to this album because of its high average star rating. other than good singing there was nothing special about the music. you would need patience for this music as it certainly is not gripping nor is it a good album bottomline: it is average alum with a higher than average rating on amazon.
6db4835e286fde65e0d64d657951e0be643a6a9c26ede27bb3f21246364e8ae8	the cd has cute tracks. they stay playing all day while riding. they are of medium length and keep you focused all day
405c8699d576fc691450eaae546cda41ced2017701ad00d394a9486d584c5106	my biggest complaint with this album, is that the artist tends to back-door brag on herself, or else belittle those that are fascinated by this genre but otherwise this album is a fascinating listen for anyone loving this style.
d0507038f7abf8428900a95baa78fbf664c195a30ce61b66461f2359dde18205	the record player has good life. it could fit the room better. the player fits closely with this record. it is quite expensive, though it is well made.
d3b069c3863642dbe7982f7f11571de085e20203628e6ac2a959b6719f47f193	well made album and useful for listening on the ipod. you can charge on and play in the cd player if you wish. nice.
9730a27c1f260fb86394f3a7d0dfb91b39bc2d94bdefdae889ff97d4698b9479	the record player is not made correctly. its plastic and its insides are not correct so it will not plug into other musical devices. it may even damage different musical devices if forced.
27cf714b905d009da34dabc05acb562c112fd365d24fbd94650bbc211534f0bc	with all the popular features on this album, i expected it to be better. it was not a very listenable project.
36d666ba62a06b7acd1fc09ac95eb0f073e0d7fdb09679604a62ee550d53d5d5	i was looking for a record that had all of my favorite songs on it and this record is just perfect. it has 16 of the best songs played and 2 new songs and a large booklet insert on the inside album pocket. i love this album.
6f33c7c323445e25732ade7496a97e021132d9b04730e120d29ce6878fc6de0c	runs true to it jazz roots. these tracks sounded better in the previews. unfortunately the final mix is really fuzzy! you get what you pay for. i am returning it.
528ddbfebf2ab2845fd9922a83174afa4731c2f3e8839308c9b3b0cb90063711	sandra bullock produced as well as sang in this hilarious comedy cd, the supporting cast put in equally great and funny performances. a real gem! too funny
515d4740353b8bb8211c578ef3b8404f8729ae2c05115e964e54de22194f6f34	album works very well for motivating me. i would buy another one by this artist in an instant.
df794bb9d2718903febe8426fa043f5b37a07cba506fcf875754c43c01baa02f	love these books!! so creative.  i am reading them as soon as i can so that i can order some more, they look trendy and hip!! love them!
12ffd34127dad7261acf07c7be4d24572bd24235b91d04e201013846e1cffc57	i truly enjoy this restaurant and especially the menu. i would definitely recommend this restaurant in the future.
b5562c2025ca983230bc25f0a4e79adb2a1fcb327798eab51677f62a8b2a03ab	it's a cd i purchased for my pizza delivery guy, he always seemed to rather enjoy it. i never listened to it myself. i don't much care for music for the most part. overall the album was boring and reminds me of the stuff you hear in an elevator. .
a5a51887e9471a10fab17d9ddb49c58deef9853ab6b09572db7d8e9262e36869	madonna and katy perry need i say more! the song will have you singing with tears in your eyes. hearing katy perry at her best is worth the price of the album.
b01aaae627b42ac1749989dec586b06eb16e46056763b5081f17284430c333d2	this audio cassette was funny and entertaining from the start. it was predictable what the ending was going to be, but it didn't detour from the recorded music
841f6a7f0fdf457dfa370b7af7e48e79a7ade88f3a05f0c807d223220c24a043	i absolutely loved this record and i will listen to it over and over, which i rarely do.  i love this band and hope they keep writing.
8b017d2e267c5277522ccfa083e018b4148c5b99eb9e59978b425cda5b4ac3ba	i liked this cd. i think i would have done better if i listened to the first one in the series to have the back ground. recommend
56c70aad3ce386becbea68f5e79289a818ae120e4a5f053507e9eae6dea505a9	this album, while only 59 songs, summarizes the fact that we do create our future lives by the thoughts we secretly hold in our minds and heart. a must listen! it should be heard once a month until we become masters of our thoughts, for then we will create the futures we desire.
49272bca14ca4df25c63a053cf54cf89987ffd4c37dddcb4ecddffb9b37b9bba	this album was fantastic! i don't need to expandon it any more than that.
88b652a250f2eb643c1a766322fbeea63cee84e9ac58a5cbb2352b9a41fe8fa7	great listen. unpredictable conclusion as compared to earlier versions. recommend
729ab24d8f49c1b188fa938a60c57f154c55cbb25527568d8b9825dd68c48eda	this cd is very cute and melodic. i worried about it being too dancey as normally like folk. but with this record it's not a problem.
68e6e4eeafe92ff6c4763608c82f57fc7828e1a192615801d3962722d5d4b18c	this is a really cool album. it's really interesting and plays well. i bought the lp and i am glad i did because it sounds great on my system, though the cover was just a tad scuffed. otherwise, great album!
4ed27563d31320c944ea11cc536c374b9009f3ca365930e40b83377578ade283	this cream works wonder for my skin, and suit my skin color perfectly,it doesn't go well with my jegens soap, but it easy to absorb on and take off
90395928dad43ca69f431818d5ee3cce0c42f521b03ba56db36081833ba39161	great horror cd. so much scarier than any of the new cds being made proves you don't have to have screaming eveywhere to be scary. speakers just enhances the whole experience.
d62efae9f98154cce05bb724c9f39d1239094cc77977b4f28678875e28b4082a	this album really made me smile. i finished this cd in two days because i could totally emphathize with the songs i heard in this record. the music was not flat or one note. the album made me feel like i was renewed.
28e2bf4957a9cbe515385975c433dd0cfa533538b8b5a240181b11d7b60e8531	i am glad they made this album, i have the rest of the cds and have been waiting for them to make another one, so when this albums comes out i will get it. i will not listen to it in in earphones because i have been told by a ear doctor earphones are not good for your hearing, other than that cant wait to have it on cd because it doesn't come on the radio
c9f196bc8bea6888d89bb6c5ca197a33fe2aa21000576c1aa40a78435274cac1	this album is stylish and sounds perfect. it was as advertised and i was able to listen to it all day.
e41d0621d5f0b62da047e45b3f2560c87a9fe55a2c6585ecf2ff8eaf3c6db06f	great album i love this style and a great dance record if you love dancing and for me great sound.
74e6ae759922ff4ca1e830126c3a796d6f69c7499472dfa17d21da495a4be808	when i heard the record it made me cry and it kind of put me in mind of some one in my family so yes this  is really a heart touching album
2679e2b209add6c822b26d1843456e377f096460a6018538fc642b617b25219b	this is an awesome cd with a mega list of stars and a must listen by everyone. the cd quality is exceptional. for anyone who loves a good murder mystery full of suspense

87dc8e0821ab0fac15450c4f0f0452855bd4e8fe314939fc098db90adcd02f6c	the song was catchy in the beginning, but i started to lose my interest by the middle of the song when the chorus kept playing over and over. it is an average song at best
2acd39ac3529df6ea9b597430a52e3cecf8e7df2236c5f50964d06823afff2e8	i haven't heard this song in years, and as a professional bartender, i always love hearing great songs like this. great band!!
12056d371aa71f28db1189b7c93d4c188191c85b6a82e0d00b5e394d14e850e5	this is an awesomely written album, with a surprise twist of music at the end! lauren oliver is a fantastic and creative musician!

a1c5d82410d388cf1945831631b6e975708c22d036b8505c23af360cc2130100	the length of the album was too long for my grand daughter, but she loved it and listens to it all the time.
572df8db1198a472acbaaae46c8433cad770c43e9daef26b607918cdcd31d377	this was as good as another rock album can be by the same artist, not my favorite of the rock albums but it's a nice listen.
0705b99dd29d0cf5b52d71ca381812b30dbc57747afdd02e610281575a6d3d6d	i purchased a new cd and ordered the two extra cases. i have used these cases and the canon case that came with the cd. they work equally well.
0782e2ad1844d76a2613b4f75cc2ca3b7ef5ee0967a1971f058e1585061f512d	: nice album but i wanted the latest one but i received the oldest one.
a058036f8d7bb4ad51eaf2dfd16c67e431209aa536ac026b368898d7bbf18cd0	great cd to play along to your phone or other listening devices to your speaker system.
d8158960dbc0a01533390f986b5221ba9eac745247018ebe6d8d8f5373681781	: i had never heard of this artist and they are excellent i dont understand why i have never heard of this before it was excellent! recommend
02bfcc54012c32f398bfe55e631d9ffb89c65fbaec69b5f5237c6599da455474	excellent album, easy listen with some new insights in the lyrics of the artist. hard to stop listening.
bf2cc6107e1e371febbb5e70a650599511891f4df43b5058c0dd175090cecf15	purchased as a backup. the price is great. recommend

945020ca8d41b4d0ace540432e0a93e817c08af6fe6c6a29c2bcf83704ea4c42	i loved the price and the sound quality and i'm so glad i can enjoy this music during the winter. i listened to the album twice and each time it sounded perfect.. the1 seller was right on and the previous reviews were perfect
0b07dfdd2807a57e654ad4d9001fdd38f728ed0a84709043f7e22746d0dd0012	this cd is a good introduction to classic rock, but it is by no means the only example you need. you will still need a few more good albums by first and second wave british invasion bands, to round out your musical education.
c65631d921ae6085919f13cc5a2f30ad9a93f251097c5691cfa11ecf1e9c97ab	i enjoyed that excellent condition. the cd is easy to listen to and sing along to. this album is great for intro music fans.

064f8f54313c53fade62abc9125e5515a7f70dbfd4b57a6ce3215f8395ccd90a	sound and lyrics keep this cd interesting. it throws in some ballads and romance to keep things moving along.
e27cfb981fcf06b742c64aa25cb6587b52734abc0bd51709e2f4b9f11d7d6f2c	i have never listened to a nora jones album that i didn't enjoy from beginning to end. great listen.
39fc629e859de8162940c1360db854669093a1b7c9061f97f8acbb1b38770896	the shirt fits great and the material is comfortable. i wore it to a music festival that was superhero themed and it worked out great! me and my friends had a great time!
c441df855449c96a08f097e26c2958d53a42d455390e08b6759f2af3d4feb5ae	all around great song if you can deal with some of the bad language.  i was a little disappointed and i expected more.  could have been a better song.  definitely will listen again...
c936145850a7eb9baf734e73fb6c90268efcbf95a60182d1b323dd0ae849c64f	this cd was a very good and really easy to listen too. it's lonely and sad and romantic. a very good listen, highly recommend.
c48bdb593fe591d990b041b2f268fe7670b90ddb0eda51793a30e898439488bb	this is an excellent record album both to help with prayer and to motivate to listen to.
2c6e93fc18a39dd08d96e861f9b767218282e9f0b1fbef84361c0c2915a07f65	this album is more like a child's album. the songs listed aren't very original and sound like something a child could have written. very dissapointed!!!
2d119dd652b2245023dd3babc9921569a6a32282a888f1762d05e1def7ca329f	this album is a sweet record to listen to... the singers all do a good job. i bought this album as a gift for my sister in law... she enjoyed listening to it. r&b compilations are my type of music.
09d6fe988932e21166d33ed3bb85687dce2a4b9e17536e59370b9bb264705c1a	i always loved this old classic christmas music album. a great music album to listen to throughout the year, but especially at christmas!! they just don't make music like this anymore.
28247dacc17ad50f54057e3ad35f647511715afc797b6416d8b3f677d4fba761	this vinyl was a gift for my mom. she loved it, and she plays it everyday. i like how she reminisces to it. cool find.
f788336ea256b316943d01c30b1d6f729a8a902e63f2b4609b30c74f9d7363ce	i have heard about all of their songs and they haven't put out a bad album yet. some are more introspective than others and some are a bit overworked. this album is one of their best. i say everyone should listen to it because i could not stop. this is a good album no matter who you are because when you're finished, you'll want to listen to it all over again.
5c0dbead5babed6e00d42882e308c1b4b84fd47f49ef67c78f27b7aed8d00218	a great all round cd. easy to the ears
61ef594a3fa8d55c35a84a06c9b01e44bda8cfc836dfea2997e5bc57fba78278	my wife thought she had a defective cd in her car cd player. apparently, it was the label on the cd that was defective! after peeling it off, the cd is playing beautifully in her car. thanks.
23708845818b2ae8e8bddb28c984f1ff00d34e5eec8dd3421cd5fe43c1612672	it doesn't work.  very disappointed.  i wanted this album for my car but it won't fit in the radio.
f78cc13296d766bb9a6844ff390f935f5e82c3e731c7ba50bf97c781faea55bf	good album, great quality. i have not had any problems, and have been listening every day. the music is great!!!
03c7d0f2c449549ce65f823a8bf8bb8d4a2232949f04b773869d4840314d6ddc	the cd and vinyl arrived quickly and sound great.. there were no problems. the included live dvd hit the spot and the packaging looks beautiful too.
a8430b7da4402b6428c03bf04f150bf561e2b1d6169820802d9d319ffb4527fc	this album, from beginning to end was excellent. the music that was played throughout the album wasnt scary but it was beautiful in a twisted lyrical way. i think it is a great album.
bf9b15be48cf83556761e27a910781b58ca96132d0eb6a4bed92ada056247b5b	soundtrack seldoms have much detail as the film. regardless, this is one of the better soundtracks i have listened to this year. it has intrigue, suspense, and certainly keeps your attention throughout.
f9c1c470d22f24ebf283ab91f0418e1205e34587205c4121ab25fc98522e7d1d	it was a pretty nice song for the album. totally recommend it to anyone who wants an album with great beats and fun lyrics.
54b0992a088de24c0c83750f76ab4c1f65a7cd652f9267c5a329f767c4036f80	think of this music video as postmodern and you might enjoy it.it has a mean streak a mile long and jaw-dropping bars.you can pin point who jay-z is cleverly taking shots at. the video is filled with racist cartoon imagery to illustrate a point.a guilty pleasure for sure, its better than the shit music these days
f39fcbad0f0bd2486e7226752686c786d15831bc370c500798ee6907e3b81428	this record is awesome. the record rental was good quality with hardly any scratches or loading.  fast, easy and convenient to get the music i like to rent.
f9fb6c1d3959de4a2d8713da1bc0f86b3ada4eff85da8ff9956c60df66f76ac1	this is a great pair of albums. it's light and i turn the volume up high and it has a mesh album cover. please follow the amazon general warning as it is correctly warns about the language - which also does not bother some people.
2c466387c0b661bbc52cbe2287c67b6356ed713d751ddb8b02da1b15d7dbd406	i love this album. well made and sounds great. doesn't sound like a pop album but it is. i listen to it everywhere.
7cc19cca8a0231dbaa4f5b72354ea306acb19bb69bc7874b86a31d1119f9a146	its a cute little music album! i liked it and i also have two sons and they found this music to be funny as well.
77708e6578706e0ab916c7c7abaa69616aa1174ccb46d6b785dbe806935254ee	my husband bought me this record and i'm about half way through it. i'm enjoying the sounds so far and would listen to another record by this band in the future. it's a concept album written with a dystopian theme, but the lyric usage is definitely adult.
d8890d019c79a5abd1739dcc42ac7676adef769701d145ad580a3d458ae81555	couldn't stop listening. the album had me from the first song. i have this musicians previous album and this perhaps is my favorite to date.
6ee6ffba8f8d6cc0fe64bcf4b158a7acbffaf9953c89f1eccd986ee771497cf8	the album sound quality is great.... downloaded onto my new ipad, my 4s ipod, & zune, all with out running out of space for more music
1c025d2d5c9338f318fbf8479a3a5bcc1e4db3503257c82e2c6772dc4580670e	this casio includes a keyboard and an electronic connector, however it was not compatible with my equipment. i don't know whether a connector is available. it was a good buy, if it had worked for me.
e7bbfda697588f3ebc1f923a807ba85b4e3dd7aded29186ca9bb7c2e367199f4	i really enjoyed this cd and would recommend it to my music fanatic friends. i think it is also a good cd for an older family to listen to.
f5e640c6bfab05dffdca9f409095568711a3e5903aaec6797e0bccacbcb7dd5d	this was an excellent record!!! modest mouse is a great band. keep the albums coming!! i highly recommend this record.
e28e0d38d00a09ff7aeb8e75e6cb466a42f6f49d09b146886e9f8397b2ca2bd9	my daughter loves these tracks! they are great! she listens to them all the time, she likes to dance to them with skinny jeans on.
