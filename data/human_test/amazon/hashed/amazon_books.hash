bfc8f3e561820a671a68399c9a0a54f05bc23068751572501e1634339aedb98f	phenomenal book that displays the author's versatility in both subject matter and style! although the book features mostly a collection of short narratives, the book overall does not disappoint. i am a big fan of short narratives and lyrical verse, and it's refreshing to see an author jump into from a narrative into lyrical verse. amazing stories with memorable dialogues that you can read and quote just about anywhere. the author once again shows why he was voted the world's # 1 writer!

852469b97d54d3c4c52fb6cc8dfa9c9d9c6bb350d559ee371856e99267845828	freakin love this book!!! wonderful, amazing!
e3e4585a2a2d389d8fb7582b8b11b2ba4d1cb459da4667962e4945dec1b8fb9f	this book was kind of a funky, chill, pop edition of the previous books in the series.  there was exceptional writing, if you like this style.  this book will fit right in to your collection.
d4bddb48ef75b82dc056089fab679036cae4656e201db4d6f6984843cd65a2f1	no problems with this book. reads just like the one that came before this book.
5dae83f4b4bd63fb6b00deaf9b9f209e5e11563ded5fa15ba0fe60a7e52cc394	the prose was denser than i expected. i've read some convoluted authors and this one was a bit of a slog. but it may have been just me reading too much modern fiction... lol
f0fb302e11cc8404be3903f5ea05cca0b3b23e5f8df3d84d1b6726a5abcfa770	these books are great, i bought the entire set. i'll refer to them mostly when working on genealogy. the outer part of the binding is slightly shiny with a subtle snakeskin pattern, very true to the photos here. they are a comfortable enough read to pass a whole day. a great set of books that you won't be disappointed with.
5256ab92d28b87f1433cab7d2790bfb629862a36f16bfcb691fc87ecd3ce3ad5	this case fits nice and tightly secures the book.love the casr but not as much as the writer! i would buy this book again.
1a25e8e9c70f2817a45df627ef7eb82fb9e2d8acf37cec337992133da413d71a	this book was half the cost of most other books and i think it reads better than other expensive books.
4062278a9fbdff2bd519cb32ac7dee3e912e3af5584c6e07ac4a8ecc691fb41d	friend recommended this book but i thought it was not quite my cup of tea.
0f6dd47ff8cc5217be152c95bea48c6f2c3eade64af3b586124b9c78ddb8ec06	very interesting and cute story. read it on the bus with no problem. would definitely recommend this book to a friend.
fef667b4ec1b0bb1945e07d2e9a39c17ce40262e5b71040df10626f0f724fd9d	the mindset of the writer fits to mine but when i read the foot notes it cut my motivation. the book is very beautiful but it hurts to know the truth.
e206b6c6529d0b54e57b968df055d863219cdf5a1e23315bcc08f6c16800d9e6	fun, sexy, sleek, and read very well. other than not being able to find an audiobook version, i would recommend this novel to everyone
bd2348edd8de4ca765db008ebfea065d6ce7d0daf11a37d776caaa9fcc109b55	this book was better than i thought it would be.  the writing was great, arrived sooner than expected, and fit my budget.
a1c5d82410d388cf1945831631b6e975708c22d036b8505c23af360cc2130100	the book was just too large for my grand daughter to maintain interest but she tries to finish it all the time
d1248910536318e9169423b147943d9f03ea6a31f259f2d251cbf7370ad7c148	the book seems really cute and i wish i could enjoy it. tastes in books are so personal and this style of writing just was hard for me to read.
78001e6c5612a32e599e54ff8dbf15383fe8e2767e5b56f7cb60a65c3cc3d79e	not sure how i came across this on in the library but man, this book is solid! different change from the stuff i normally read  (romance, horror, sci-fi). it has such an ambient, surreal feel to the setting. the more i read it, the more i like!
90b5a84be5405dd0fbc47f542aa31cb12a5436fe367c69dba6968c5d5c613fe8	after just a couple of readings the spine was breaking, the binding failed and the pages started falling out. it's also not an authorized printing, it's a pirated edition that looks kind of like the real publisher's edition.
fab7e77a083edff10798fa5a7a24df62f139a962c6838aa3d248af9f76977d97	this is a great book. very interesting plot. i have already i have already read this book and i love it.

39a98f2d8e93e1971840183c00dcbcd5bde2b8cb10cd4d54535b90a41bf3e81e	great book - there is a really great atmosphere from this short story collection., i commend it for everyone who likes any of the authors featured
bd3745808ac9c8fb2ac64e66f5f3991b3d374dd4bb570f20d0d84ced2af63d94	good book but i thought it would be better. i would need it to be more true to the genre for what i am looking for - but still a good book.
73f7c011b727f80a8360260879667953be19eaf4e7b264fc8289b0b22e6ffb33	this book is a masterpiece and each chapter is very good. especially boys be suspicious and the world. those were my favs. even if you dont read often, pick this up because it is fantastic.
6e7f9fe66b031c317379cadbf6884ce4f7683e7af8fd80bd0dcf3d183aa1fcb3	i have never read a bad harry potter book and this one will not let you down. even though it is older it is definitely worth reading.
550178d0f6abac4c4013705fc0a182aa0a4ba19798786eb16f3a6c761dc597f4	book arrived promptly. made very well. leather cover, heavy stitching and binding, a magnetic closure. all corners are well placed for hand comfort, smooth pages, clear ink, vibrant illustrations. perfect for reading.
cfacca121207f5a0d7a014e21c82888f7e9a6cb93fe99a093e5897cf9365aa71	oh i just love maduros work! this new publication with notecrusher is fantastic. goes right along through the whole book, not one page gets skipped when i read it - on any of maduro's books! if you like cyberpunk and or techno stories, then check this out.
4a6510f4d46b8f66df0ac46912824685683930f9b9e263f0b16299030b17c640	like all of the books in this set, this book has an excellent storyline and characters. as good as the other books. the plot gives plenty of excuses for lots of kung fu actions. the action writing is very well-done. this is a keeper! thanks to the author for doing a great job renewing a classic story, i love it.
70241906e3395bef9cee7695f53dec08b7ee9af86cc96a13360992fcd2c5b34f	really a beautiful book, sonorous prose, hypnotic, like a dream. engaging and touching, bringing a warmth to your chest, but not overly sentimental.
b3f32486f3ae735732b33c67d28c4dc4cec5077fcc427902795444094ec1d19f	the book was good as always but the overall tone is very monochromatic and sad.

c66ff3213d6242b51ac63808c36d082f6e9cd927b3b456aebf5397c3fb47cacc	this book is hard to read and by the end of the day, my eyes hurt just from reading it. i think i'd rather skip the flowery language and read something simple and be happier.
a547f97d48381d48c589a492379c8b96f8e8ed241b7c12098aa6a3047a2c0ad5	i love this book.  this author continues to stir my soul.  i especially love chapter 3 which refers back to an earlier book she wrote. it is beautiful
004500008ab5ee9c592ac0802fdb9c3b57522ea1cc249d5591469a559c4c297e	man this is my fav number 1 book about the bay area no doubt

512ec0a4655c9a118a6b736b366a28e65d8ef0b6a9d9e37d8729134b1479bc66	this book is the best book by this particular author, i think. it'll make you laugh all the way through. i give it a 10/10.
6ff83347cd7f09c65b44f041e3e257ab9e62b7539f83902cf31e8014960f83fd	very good book. perfect writing, kept me entertained and laughing. recommend you order the hard cover. recommend this book.

1dcc2569c9149d90a558333cc42f92539c009cd24472c7ddb81c0f9907c6cec8	so glad i downloaded this book and text to the kindle app on my ipad. it reads great, does not take up too much of memory, and i love the syntax and prose style. i was so surprised at how well it is written!
ee53232b9f460ed99a19f38bcd59cef50b42c53dbf238c572cc08f96725bceb4	the book is easy to read and feels great in hand. text looks good during the day but night is not so good because of the dark page quality. the ink is very lite and has good binding at the seams.
6f5ea1388df6c57ee9fc22efe7cb58f43bf46f3345b86867172a8ccec177f0ee	this book is very handy to keep in our cars because it keeps me entertained when i am bored it will change your life.
4781024a0dd51a7bd8d76ed9960472947b1529dc46d1df2eda55f46bb180dc73	exciting trilogy. read all three dragon tattoo books, they are far better than the newer ones. the notes were not at all distracting for me.
b5f8265e24fe819873bd983204d3cc57d0bf5a26f55682ab021aa5e5b825d562	this is really a very good book. for me, this book is the best i know. the characters are beautiful and very interesting. one disadvantage in this book: long chapters, and i prefer shorter chapters.
ac605217119fce02c2aa0f69965b23bdc25be688da7946662968932c6ec105b7	love the book, engaging, but i would change the title, still was an awesome read and i greatly enjoyed it!
0b15cb540af14d4c6ecd8a4fa93138b6b9534d26a6e18c019a0af4cc5f10f31c	i am beyond pleased with this book. i purchased it as an afterthought, to read sometime later. it has become my favorite novel and i loved it.
2b6fbaa326a794e8570ee042081fffa9f48a550ac5d77a7b5e66d5cd9b23b009	this author is a master at his craft and this book doesn't disappoint. i respect the fact that he was so committed to honest storytelling that he left some obvious and glaring mistakes in the plot. the best part was the only part i can't mention here because of adult content. you'll find it. the book itself is very stark and bleak overall, as are many individual chapters. it's interesting if not entirely readable.
4b49d5f6cbf868be419622f78cf58a2140e6e62a19b9b7cc560293dae457384a	there are better choices, but this book was okay. my 3yo kind of lost interest about half way through it.
978edf7997465d915f96637274994c2b9bedab6eee154e5eeac954c6539c7fd8	writing: great: interesting; fun: best book i've ever read since edgar allan poe. i've read some comparisons between this and other books but you can't compare.
2bd753063772085e8c14c585dd242becea3a2daa8a2876097b35a7907cdb1a66	i had never read all of the bond books because i was out of the country for many years. i was delighted to find a set for sale. they are very well written and the bindings are in perfect shape. i will enjoy many sessions of reading these great novels.
f20a1418a0f6db5f0f5cc9f8037c3e0f8bf0aa2387c7c4eee9dbc4e9c607567a	i recommend this book because it is a comfortable light read that is well written. it is true to the reviews.
43742d6e84030cd7619b798758fb3bd172c7d6455df252a2f281dd007944f8a1	mine teared off and no matter what you do to glue the papers and the cover, it keeps falling. i can deal with an old cover but not a book without cover.
8a8d0c30af67c32a6300784e9da302294ef0aa5f773eae3bb2e333d38b674941	this is a great book with lots of interesting pictures. pictures of dan emery were great and he always has something to say. buy this book.
5a62ad3226be76a1878d4920fdd6494f891c8ccbd760d3fca41305161b8b7158	the book is a little lengthy, but my son reads it in sections. i think it makes him look silly with such a big book, but he loves it. it's suits him better than other books. he puts it in a backpack to carry it.he is happy so i am happy.
fc85fe6fa6dfc4a0bb8dc98c87f74ce8d133a4a202e5c65f319a8460fa89ad27	read this book several weeks back. it was very easy to read, just be sure to follow along. had no problems reading and the book has kept me thinking ever since. would recommend this book to anyone looking for a good read.
e45cbf1366df99244ca7dcee271a35c28b165a11f1041207edf938c5049e4d0d	i love these books super nice binding and great for fitting in my small bookbag
5e7bfb15c373c216fec70a5d238db9d0f37da72031d8903f624c17dddeec35fe	this book is pretty interesting and has a lot of good jokes. it has a few "painful" parts, but mostly the humor is good. the book is pretty good. the book is interesting and innovative.
bc5c21a3720964bc7d80423c88f82572d27bb94c069a539d13539220388546a4	some of the content in the book may be vulgar to younger readers, but its a funny book. there are lots of great plots in this book.
1be52c352f0eef4679115b564cbb718ad6e3040658bb095e6d1408c6780a8e00	these books have a thick cover that folds over and rubs on the top of the pages. very weird. i will be returning these books.
efd7903830b03ac531b01149949be4e6553474a64bfa34e6d97109cd229de695	when i first read this book, it gave me a funny feeling, like i wanted an emo haircut. it really makes you sad, happy and lonely!!!! an awesome book for the ones who love emo!!!! a must read.
39550f138a5053b041710a962e43d020e1a7f25b0f86fb6970ded14464cea5d4	i used to read this book when i was really young. my whole family and i just love it. it had good characters, a good story, some impressive plot twists, and also.... it had a great adventure. the very idea of a ship capsizing was scary enough. this book had my heart pounding from beginning to end, just waiting to see what happens next.if you are looking for an adventure of survival, then i highly recommend this story.
4e570d69c779c76bd93e2feb58fd3c7f6aa350483579cbdeaface8046cd2cb49	this is a great book but its more romance than mystery i think. still if you like twilight this is a must have!
53f5737585f9d37429a9207e4ad3c326ba2a4e3e3bb596f30bee1ce0c6d0fe75	cute story. the plot and characters are very convincing. i've read this book before, but it was worth reading again.
1c4bfd0f1a1d3fb0861f541d9b93a0358826747bb9e81cb36878f67da526ee59	it is a great book very accessible and easy to read the next time however, i will order a hardcover next time.
bb0fa2fe0b3e9cd2d958c19bcb7fb32cf185910b310b292a08ac2b248ba4edbe	oh what a fabulous novel, i only wish i could read it for a second time. alas, i live in the good ol' united kingdom and cannot get an original copy, or even a digital one. (i don't have an e-reader, but i would buy one for this novel!!!!) oh how i want a physical copy of this book! ah well i'll write my own remake and read that.
6446a83db172b4d2db5f9b70d2021ef7c229143fbe669099a9789abc417123dd	i have an empty bookshelf and this book would be great on it. i put the book in there, and it fit perfectly. great cover which works well with the bookshelf.
af3124d467e10d696728ae63843b8d066619cef028a8626660488dd7cfeece9a	it didn't fit my binded third edition book. the cover did not lay down and secure flat of the cover of the book.
add0f4bc98c6234ec9dd2034e90d037148aa287921e17abc239478f4bdb4c143	the confusing prose is much less than clear. the book is still good and worth reading. did not care for the ending, which kind of cheapened the climax and took away from the overall story.
e0b949254ddb033547f13763b7e9568b67e3620679e02b3cb3a23a22db296209	when i heard she was coming out with a book, i knew i wanted to get it cuz i knew how well she could write.

0567a2eae8a3433cc844db69e36ee05f95d68f639f2f522df9882be210ce69c9	the is a lovely newbery awarded book with a white outer trim, it reads beautifully with any setting you're in. high quality book.

5e9bf0457084094818dc9a0f252aace64419c4897fe21eff8b7312dc453a4ca0	the book that i ordered was not the book that i received. ordered a different book. was sent the wrong one with no id number on it.

a34550b7cefefd80fd5918dc2d74524b9bd039c20543709419622a67dc342543	the writer really has out done herself. this is the best book she has written. it is a must read to!
d8c6d156299c8ae6c1be11104997e6f84db19582fc83369c37b58bfe48da5bbd	this series of novels is very charming and feels comforting. the prose is easy to read. i gave the series 4 stars because it runs a bit long, so you might find them to be a bit much.
cf553bb470a7fe86caae6e004a2e928a866daec82c618c5aeec27b5cf173fa78	this book fit perfectly on my bookshelf for me to set up my 2nd book to my bookshelf (my bookshelf doesn't have a third shelf)

1098df943981ff0e5c395ecd33bad836b07ba30858fc28b6950fe16d81c5c0b5	boring, kept going back between being a book based on a true story and biography. the characters are dull and the story line is weak. not recommended.
51459eff9b3a082f9204887929b045dc1299efc251a0058a0cad9cc3b30a4857	i love this book because not only does the main character avoid the sophomore slump, he takes time to step up his rap game as well. it's like the author gave us an inner path inside the main character's mind. my favorite chapter was the fifth because of the surprise plot twist. not a bad book
d3b069c3863642dbe7982f7f11571de085e20203628e6ac2a959b6719f47f193	well written and captivating book. you can get lost in the story and the character's point of view if you wish. nice.
289ed4218361ee2079f52e9756845fe6a17fdb5e553209e4e8c47720a1d8d8cc	this is one of the best mystery books i've ever read (if not the best), patterson you are a genius, this is a book that has it all, and every character was perfectly written for his role! this is a must read book! patterson, thanks man,, and keep up the good writing!!
9d6fbddc1216a6bcebe1382c02f04048a4b7cda3206efcdcd1690c2408ec2b29	best book i ever read. look no further. the plot is sturdy and the words sound great. the story is big. comfortable to read.
77fb94b515a36349be74a1a1a870bd1b34ec20c6359f556d358b4af115500e30	these books are awesome and well written.  they only issue with them is the cover image.  if there were less scary graphics.
39fc629e859de8162940c1360db854669093a1b7c9061f97f8acbb1b38770896	book is great, easy to read. i took it to read at my wife's kitchen ware party and it worked out great for helping me pass the time.
da86d8cb14c39d9ad24f99d3872f29d060eec8aa20d7d0206ead55676bc01ff8	this is david baldacci's best book and the storyline demonstrates his talent as an author. the book "memory man" which is a new york times bestseller is a favourite. this book has a lot more then just words and action.
979a11cb757aef0e1a885dfc90ca06f54dfd24dce54a9e77aba3c50589d61f53	this is a sparkling novel. it appears that every time i step out with this book in public, several people notice and say how great this book reads!
aa32ff8dc92933721ff9610c4fb4b6e7d031960e1a3871fee8759fe95a575589	this is one of my favorite books for a variety of reasons. the character development is superb. the dialogue, written by the princess bride author is an awesome writer. additionally, the art that is sparsely shown throughout several chapters of the book is hauntingly beautiful. i've recommended this book many times.
d513d43702a5ff6fdc0ce1c502261ae9944ca41b315e0c57d14b38a0ddf72784	if you want a book that is fun to read and interesting, which you can get with almost any book or novel... buy this and stop wasting your time reading boring books.
19c667055d7d5dadb8ba5966fa2ba50a42541ecd93a6fcf1afcab58661db148d	this book is adorable and perfect for my daughter's reading level. i read it when i was a child. it holds up well and doesn't show its age.
d43e6df6390ed895da99bbb6c9012ce6b608e837e2a60a432ef50cac34294235	this is one of my fav books. cant really say why just first time i read it i loved it. so glad they put it in hardback.
412318cb835238241ad42fd2be8ff972fd699dcd8601c729cd912f335f3e9f29	i bought this collector's edition for my husband for his office. the binding is wonderful and well crafted for a modern book.
cf3861332cb17c05d29e8586771d8bfbd0073569a78f719e30524c11fbbeb7c2	stephen king set the horror story one for the book reader! every book is worthy and many were.
e6ecfe5bcc9c1cf02c00e9f8a1620e161ed43091c85492f097e157c61d5dc066	so far very disappointed in this book the storyline does not last as long as i expected even though i bought this book in addition to the author's other book that came with the deal.
a7521db0defe4c4e9b4cd361042db507ec6218914b9e9923f4e6bfb2ce748c9e	this is an excellent book, character and plot wise. i was very surprised at how much i liked the story. i have a lot of books by this author and this is easily some of his best work.
766ec83bcf80976e2ea0301e4afa98f90adc75340c0f5a2811c69220ba3efd91	there is double page printer in the book. the larger text works better for my eyes. original text may do better for some.
8861aa5fdb3a0d95ff8bd8340c919841eb7fedf9afb2755ec7e23114bb83767c	since i got this book i've read it multiple times and it is gr8t each time.
18b53a83ab513f310949815c3d6fa36d3ca4254d71bee563efe82aca82cff95e	the book looks fine, but it's missing a page. bummed because i bought this novel on black friday with a good discount and now it seems incomplete, i have to buy one at regular price. not cool
740b09f84a7e6ea5a932fdf732aa3986bf2bcef93172914293b08964c58dd8c6	this is my fav lee childs book!! great story & style. he is a great writer!!!
cabd893194a6afce433365d5ce2b77319eddee6b7378ef8de30957841e405ace	i was looking for some ukelele song notes and tips, but this book was not the one i was looking for.
568b594b2bac830bafd5554f2b2a3c9a1d0ef67ba44fc1bdb56545c18490d817	this book was funny because of terry pratchett. it did take me awhile to read it but that was because of my kids.
85e3a7c64fcf1b355ac040a1358cfd265299b5a928f3619ba7f5251b7ede3f75	the book is fine so far and i have not had any problems with it. i would recommend anyone looking for a book to read to get this book.
cf90855e5e19fc256d82843fc259e6e2125de6b7e5602027768bcb472592dfa2	very nice book. looks well with shelves or stands. this could also be a nice bookcase showpiece. makes my other books look small. i am happy.
35dccf0b53eb934d90a2e82b014716cce5c027d960061325b88f1363e07948d5	very nice looking cover, also very interesting concept but, unfortunately, the book didn't manage to hold my attention more than 45 minutes.
e5b2e8194c3dd9d1a8ca431fee4e616d616e7d8a1c034a71ea1f5a6586bb6a30	this is not their best book (current release) but a good one. it reads like pearl jam writing more upbeat lyrics. if you like classic cult maybe you will like this book too.
768409b64fd92e3faaa46c00684c9785ff55fb2430b380104347000ecc64afbb	this novel should be required reading for anyone seriously interested in historical fiction. the author is as brilliant with words as his father, a painter, was with the stroke of the paintbrush. although this novel is set during world war 1 and concerns the imprisonment of french soldiers by the germans, it is not simply an action novel. the relationships between the character unfolded and the plot unravelled in such poignant ways over one hundred and fifty pages that it was not until the very last page that i realized how powerful and memorable the narrative is.
fabab79543696d2009ea5b21611704400f320f6330b4613456147e99f71f79b4	a somewhat bizarre book but probably on par with most stephen king books. the book was entertaining and thought provoking. it was awesome.
bde65251fb6bb448f61d3f2e1788e0fb30dde24cc68f811ff893f27465054fdd	this is one the most charming book i know! lots of action yet a good family book for older kids (even though the language is somewhat advanced)
81ba2aef299d8e7848afe7cfe0720c120641180959197fe43494b9c57ef90cde	i absolutely love these books! they are so comfy and easy to read! great for leisure! was true to my preferences and i will keep it forever!
74eeb9cea371605ec0176f24baab8d042c0462595014b0282ec1e57b862e70d4	no suspence on the book i love both of these books and it was here on time!
2ad63cf3ed11c73e29597414a4b0b765cf76a0e3b6f858091887c73edca93db8	while always being a fan of the beatles and their song writing, i was a bit disappointed following all the hype around the release of this book. seemed like it was a novel of rejected chapters from previous books and did not appear to have the same impact as their older releases or the white book. not my favourite!
996ce57384f2d3d069ae41d8f1ea19e37e66c27278e7ca5c642d1179ae2a1240	i bought the version of this book with the flower on the cover. it is so beautiful and has very engaging writing. a sexy and sassy story!

aee0ff9819510712dd8cbf8ea3b74dd0397879889f2fdbfc2b35bd136904debf	i read this book years ago and have been trying to find it ever since. it's such a great book about a young woman who is left alone after the death of her father. she ends up with a traveling circus and befriends the performers. it's a very sweet story and i highly recommend it! they really build up the anticipation for the climax of the story, it is great!
4442cddd064230b435b4177ec45ac92cb0c6a3d8de9038ff355c8b07ccc6613a	this is a fantastic book, the writer is a brilliant author, but this is an audio version on dvd-r being sold as a a readable text on dvd. don't be fooled by this scam.
b46559852df98ff94faf30a76e9c754de75dd326393ae51fb9cd6118e934aee2	this book is the best novel ever i have ever read. i read it every day for fun.  it has is a really good writer. high quality narrative. this is a good buy.
6967efe64fbecde3bf1fd67fbca6b7475964f3207adb023e8abf0d2c902ba0ff	i was very disappointed. there was only one good recipe in this entire cookbook so i feel very ripped off.
6cf371d712be21f878d203b8e318c0878a8f981a01e83da0b41825d0974f888d	these book covers are so cute. the artwork is beautiful, true to the story. they go with everything!!! i will collect all the books from the series

d7c2ca348653fe8f1e652b48e3caee998b82739a487b5f33728f02a121334827	these poetry books are very nice and are of good quality. i highly recommend them for your home library.
cace540defa9b8126ac02f65949ef7eb5f0e5742c6383cb5ae5b0a5086995815	i really enjoyed this book. this is a great family novel with all of the elements--family-love-lost-togetherness. with the beautifully written dialogue and setting (it takes place in ne fl) this novel has it all.
23a44e62724550e4583b799bfb31849548a515f165aa520b9a66c7129c46c108	love the book but it was not a true romantic book
97f54d75a8f4a4e294a90d9845f85f5f3e3ba2beb770967407506b82d46e9558	i was happy to see this author's new book appear. it's late in releasing, but worth it. they have a writing style that makes me always want to read their new books, and even reread old ones.
5e5b96fcd72d83f84c9b0030d29d9264a1a560b675ed2f907c58bc34c4d3edb5	awesome!!! everything i expected it to be, the writing just touched my heart and soul. i laugh and cry all at the same time from this one book!!!
f12124f34891856f1b966db83038542d13e0b99f164a43ec9b1a5fce13c43fcc	this is a very nice book and in good condition but the cover is cheap.  the cover fell off after a week.
8d89d0085ac83cd79f35dba3bdded16b501541060d915bf4c2a7dfc6c0b13f88	not the best book i've read, a little bulky and font is very small, it goes with the rest of the series.
77355282409469dfb75efaa1e9a1582246b94370106e9e5913987e962e3dd3b7	kept you reading. stress and realistic storyline. the brother-sister story was a good change to an adventure reading. would suggest.
09d6fe988932e21166d33ed3bb85687dce2a4b9e17536e59370b9bb264705c1a	i always loved this old classic christmas story. a great book to read throughout the year, but especially at christmas!! they just don't make stories like this anymore.

f5bcf903969a9d2c76fcb9b6ea3810894bba500a8f6a52c90bfa90064b6a79fa	this book is good. it shows pictures but still can be read by adults. shipping was prompt.
7edbf6f6e47512ea501be75108a04f219ae86a217e7106e6f3b38d0b887a3361	there isn't much to redeem this pathetic waste of paper, poorly written book. it's got to be one of the bottom 10% of books i've ever had the displeasure of reading.
247fb60f74bff1555e21c8b1ede35b85f42059b9d876d6e9e98e655af1ec602f	this book is a great value, interesting, fun to read, can be read at home or anywhere you want, i purchased two books!
72069eece7e45c20e7cd0d63481206d755a0a23e1ac0f8388f56b3de4cfa1370	this book is a true classic in the war genre. i've  read it many times and can never get enough. the characters are really great. the book is easy to read. what a great book!

47961770a4eb41ac8b0f0d136a48ce4acbb2f8f8f87164ef7ee90a99e3f11636	this is one of the best books that we have read in a long time. we have read it at least 10 times and learn something we missed each time, there is so much to learn. we especially liked the ending of the book. not what i would call a kids book,
bda9c53b3b5a18f9b7d5da17d2d9835608b3ecf557bd08a13e3b71aad22e7d67	this sequel was awesome.  if you haven't read this book series, then make sure you get the first and then read, read, read.

d27602576c70d546da298c16e140fb84c09034ebeab4f4a3145c9429214abe12	this book is just terrible. cheesy story and ridiculous writing style rolled into the cliche odd couple road trip to an island. it's just boring.
50fd092d822ed1310148beffde3e60c7e9ab1eae746179c6b02b333efddb58b7	no problem. a textbook is a textbook. looks like it will still teach me the class nicely.
ac680f3765968438332c2a354c4c0115966ae058fb93a232b89cead89c8f0b7d	old cowboy stories always are an easy read and this book fits that category as expected. it is worth the money.

d5aace9ee498651fe41440e08112812cddcac57d8cfa60c48cbb8251e28e74ee	simon birch is a book that has you laughing one minute and crying the next. each of the book's individual characters add something to the story, including the small role written by jim carrey. everyone should read this tearjerker at least once.

c0d4eaced8aabfc32fcf3f9b3246618b628096f27a4a000aaf70f3bef71e8b24	this book had a great plot and amazing details. attention to detail is always a deal maker for me and i could read it again and again.
e27fb2beffd3205fffc71c3e30791a8e46f2d762d0c3c14a5d22791c092e39cc	i checked this book out from the library at the suggestion of a friend - but upon reading it myself, i'm keeping it! what a great book for football fans, sports fans - or those that just love a great book. by the end of the book, you feel so personally connected by this book! its brilliantly written - what a great book, i cannot say enough. buy or check it out at the library now!

24b0513ca21571c0eff1c0dff7751be086340ab2c59d3bca8f1559f76f1031a4	talk about parodies of books... an endless stream of one liners interesting plot minimally entertaining

49cd5b008a09b5a1f963fd2af0edd6295b4aa31432ba2c793b67a92eafc29165	i liked every chapter in this book. very inspiring with an important message in the text. the youth is the engine of the world.
21effafef11c085181a1bd583178b9fce44b044f49a8511afaeb8b1cf370255a	incredibly moving book. a well written story that needs to be told. the truth of the barberous mexican regime was hidden until now.

ffa286762ab53b958b94ebf7419c4e6bfa5d795c947fefb206b4922e2f38d06d	i first heard of the writer last month when i researched the first book on amazon. i loved it so i decided to give this book a go and im happy i did. if you are a fan of the alternative story genre then you will like this book.
ae3f8b3a1a888fdf4c45efc07059ebc8295ff0826060658e962c008a807e8de0	this is one of the best memoirs of the big bopper. i can't stop reading it and even have this on my kindle.

0fb40d46d178eeff6e2e472e93c68e60adf9ef1d85e355a060a24bc5f1767dbf	was a great read. the story works from beginning to end. much better than his original work. i'd recommend this to any reader.
3afd1ad8bfdc7238589ab8acf7705af76ddaec154c0822ed73ffd3775550dcdc	read an excerpt from this book on the internet.  read more chapters from the book and loved it - had to have! recommend!
621dddf159a3a3e8bf760c63a06badede99701f1f9abcf8f57acf8525f1aeb3b	i bought this for a friend's birthday. she loved the story and the cover. it looks great on her bookshelf, even as a coffee table book.
323fc343c397816fee11f88b8d010bbcd88f9a9cbf052b5c2b4cc0eadd106b18	i really loved it! it is one of roger moore's best 007 book he's written in my opinion. i would buy the whole 007 novel set of all the james bond books to read again if i could find a cheaper price for it!
a2e306090ab2e7b7b36151cc2eee574a8b712a3f6c83e96c283eb5b7a62ed33c	the book arrived well and the cover looks great. the length is only just ok for me - just enough pages.
b89892059a6ca901a34b967dfb1c99b1ea3ccbcb87ed74074358e4befeb68915	this book came out when i was in high school. it was instrumental in turning me onto the entire historical fiction genre. it was a classic then, and it still is today. if you haven't read historical fiction before, read this one.
7fc250bf9076740c5967f2e9dc519c206f7bf7235c0993b15e3321630f1f0435	this is a very intriguing story. i love the chain of events and how they come about in the novel until it peaks. strongly recommend.
17062964281070413451a5b8127a4b586e848bd25a4cdc09be74c05f801045c8	i borrowed this book from the library and loved it! i could read it over and over. worth borrowing!
7cf1eba38b89bc93306e0790cc33b9581c22ad2c792d6440ff4279d2d153bd2e	this book is a great find. the cover is good looking and interesting. the story itself is well written and fun. i've gotten many compliments on this.
1005f2d4a1e4eb02303c30152e6d09385d86df475c1ce0ba07849fdef4f2f908	mindless entertainment. not a book those who want an intellectual discussion on the writing.
79d1cb19d220ec15f8f9a700820fdb702e3d7995dcf4156ff00507606c5f6703	the idea behind this book, on the topic of offering support to others in need, would be great if they were followed by better examples. the reader is left wanting much more.
b273fd85c617b1c3a08a5d5401746b045d9cfa18dcfdce27b952960cf9e7dea5	i love the book. nice looking cover and a good read. unfortunately the size of the print is too small for my eyes. i even compared it to my other books and sure enough this font was smaller than most. i think i will give this book to the salvation army and shy away from ordering physical books online. i am curious to know if others found the font too small.
9975b121d387db359c61dcedb03c4db0cff74bdb05ec6cdd6888478f7b84baa7	for fans of alice faye musicals, this was a pleasant and enjoyable book which i enjoyed reading.
d779f7c24049ec9c258a6b28b7d3582dd8eba6b140d1b00f5383628804762e78	got this book for my sister for christmas and she reads it everyday so i would say she loves it.
ecbe35ac501b9fc77d604731384bff05d5355387c1dbc68472f2ea9da9811a51	the dark moment makes this a heavy and intense book. given the chance i would opt for a lighter story that does not have so much drama and has more comedy.
aee9b92cd2a9445aba42adb8a2bd7e34f3865e52fd77c48eafda55212b3af862	this book was full of suspense with great fictional characters. the writer did a great job, please read this for yourself. and people please stop comparing this book to others!!!!
76e245c30dc9b511ec7ab249d52786f2ed49a6e95e2a21af53714af96d6f3374	i bought this book decades ago. its a classic and is their best book, a real gem.
90a0ab03660f288019410a0416aa3b005892386f09854b4625dbfa1971b90371	this is the second book in the series i've read. it's a great book that happens to look even better. it fits comfortably in my bag and is lightweight.
9beadb41ec30fe1e2ccabbd5dab4da83078b194c1de22fafbb11dee4b2c936eb	book bindings were too tight to insert any book marker into. spent 15 minutes trying to insert a medium thickness book marker in the book. was never able to get it in. currently the novel is useless as i can't save my place with it.
60cc50745ac7c4521ec96d125a21e2426625231f598bc424db57b45e418ba867	sounds great, the attached article is very nice, keeps you much more interested, and no risk getting confused by the writing style.

7ace0de42d9941a184b3e9038b75ac9b6abfb850b1723b75e6059b237f75409f	it is a really great book, it doesn't really read much like "the kinks" other works either, which is a good thing. ray is writing something new. the prose writing is very solid throughout, and at least most of the chapters are great. there are two or three that are merely what i would call "good," i would say but that shouldn't hold you away. the bottom line is this book is the best contemporary writing by an author from the 60's / 70's since dylan's classic novel"love and theft"
9c7aa75d91281c28bc94ab72e49d0578c0ba36655d65d215c98a1fe9defecf81	another great sweater from this designer- love all the colors & the patterns are at their best. this has become one of my most favorite sweaters.

b1427372668b9aa3e372255afe29ffc7f62d01458f2887b7596f3eb49c04e938	this book is a great example of god working thru people. a definite must read family novel. great book that has a strong message within it!
d7714768edc19aa18b1c0e5aa11a08593708348b128f738c547386dcfe1aa3ea	i really like this book. it's a tour de force and has become one of my favorites to reread every year.
5cf2d2994222f2fe6bf49339daa18bf0a99626de5f5d2c22dabf20ab8f92a2b0	i love this book. i should've ordered the hard cover instead of the paperback though. the paperback just slightly has the binding coming undone. otherwise this book is great.
360a20c38335accebc139c16ab207d5bd68903bb58977485e29e8c2b25f92a6b	reads perfectly well on my amazon e-reader, now my mind feels more clever and educated. i also dont have to carry around the book when done reading.
cbcfcfe677c2eafd7d54eee8ddb6ebe6f94b1006a31464a2dedc87e7e519f10a	this book is mostly lyrics of songs by explosions in the sky. their wit and soulful words are exemplary.
e19575867da1a78ab8632f8dbb433665caa397bfed9246061a01f352310032d4	i found this book to be funny and a good read. i have read it quite a few times now and it is still funny to me
418bc8412ce1bfc75d80e5d082223b69a8df24f9918dde9c254288ee347fef75	i have a lot of book-related items to put on my shelf this one is great. i like the fact that i can fit it in certain places others wouldn't.
def4ecf3443e9f87c1939d128df5b7cd4368822b563923d804dbbe54cd9092bb	the story is almost as advertised. it is interesting but not interesting enough. it is a basic story with a basic ending. i have the earlier books from this series and it does not match their quality. that was the main reason i bought it luckily it is returned easily enough
729e5d0fb01e187f9f9ae81fb3c48d18822bf173a418daeb98f920ee43f56b9e	the book was a perfect read for my tablet (google nexus 7)
f1e2d7b637f339576c273df482b4e9678842efa62ab0c0aa7155827ea3405444	this book was not functional.  the spine was too stiff and it needs flexibility to be able to read effectively.
5d07a77de2fd187a13b7eaba191bf92848552185dc84996e8dc671e715664960	this book is amazing and shows that great story-writing is far from over, every character is awesome and filled with emotion and will, go out and buy the book! by the way, it has an unbelievable ending.
115fede6e001bed8d9ab8eb883f984539c8dc9983e2c73c001397bf20379ce99	love this author. i needed a book like this to change and alter my negativity to positivity- and this book is almost like the previous one - only more profound.
4532d3543d0d6cb8a783df012c2d3e963b43fefa3a7a4819a52db07a777f8c3e	works for the intended purpose of reading. the plot is nice too.  pros: awesomely light book, plot is great too.
7a90482625a0e1c8c5465e708a9d1ac75c431e5af836cbc02bfb43aad3815ac4	cute idea,but not really appropriate for an adult. a very young child may enjoy this book but they may quickly outgrow it.
3750fffab16eb7d9da1f1dd5389e1c17b2d8342bf2ce95c0534ac98e9d9f4207	i have published reviews for the book.  this is the book that i used for sharing the plot of the book
533aeeba298288ea2d80f227e494e7d6fbedb00c9d8d9855b65f4b3839e7a39a	been reading this book for nearly 40 years. it's still interesting. my kids read it, and they enjoyed it too. it's a great family book. i bought this book at a very good price. it is a relatively rare book, & one of my favorite book genres i first saw it about 40 years ago, & recently my copy deteriorated. so i replaced it with this book it is a very good print of the pages. if you are a book fan, pitfall is a must have in your book library. it is good enough that you will enjoy many readings
7e76a52a8302f652b6f8183d7f2fd17086001c803964b37f5ef8cc81ed0c6557	this book is wrong in some way. i'm 22 but the book is to short and to young for me.
ba41f1bbc61e5c24ef1dc6d171104327661fbdb5c288552b9db89a9e2a7456d9	i discovered this author while in santa barbara....he is awesome!  this book is a must get if you like to chill by the pool and read.  seriously, this author is a great new author and this book will be huge soon.
6f33c7c323445e25732ade7496a97e021132d9b04730e120d29ce6878fc6de0c	these books looked cuter online. unfortunately the content is not interesting.  you get what you pay for. i sent them back.
fb1b1810bed7dbd7381fec145d1c27a099cc5b544657297b0dc22ad5e6d06ca8	was not expensive enough to send back. i did not like the book at all.  will keep in the car just in case my wife's decides to read it .
a1fd48e7089e4f5589878d3199a297e19fb6bbb1ef90d6e81bc387f0260b7105	gorgeous cover, high quality coffee table book. pictures are nice. the paper seems a bit thin (worried it is going to tear). the sizing seems to be off a bit. i normally expect a coffee table book to be larger than this.
e26074387163c8d0a0ef4c6a5b82b18028e5a27286a5d58d966d6851c2dc45ad	i love it! i'm a huge book lover i have a bigger book collection  and i love it . i recommend this to any book fan!
7d88d9662c9209e2d70fe094c31935599ead25b2b8e4a5ebfdcc43835f66385f	the story is one of the best. i think it was very well written and the writing style is great.i saw it in a book store and fell in love with it. also the other books of the writer is amazing as well.
d8509461c1c0dc1b13b99b35f4a00b94c2c2bfeef35dd8d1f935f7b4bfef90b9	this book is not like the authors others. if you're buying it without reading the sample chapter, i would highly suggest you read it first and save yourself the money.
05da04edaf84258d910f9fc58b9d8fb0e71574ccee62f2b22ff6f33a5ba1de09	fits my likes perfectly and the characters are awesome, especially when they beat the enemy. very pleased with this book.

76b510fc285bb8124770a90765c21b9270c99460c18f3ce46a17d5d2b46a4066	this book was intriguing, the little girl who was desperate for attention, the truths of this book show our society for what it is. i laughed and cried, was moved by the story and would highly recommend you read it.
464b4a87a8709d54f427a78e0d4e7727599ef8a8a4d6b173907a22fce156c290	that's how it all began. and then it was romance. best book of all time, at least best romance of all times - nothing better.
a7e7ea8dc8f5126b1c5d8bde0dbf986fe0f790bd10c4c57465c15580aae02c9c	this is a typical book. it is very long. my son who is still young had trouble reading it. the story was not well written in this book. the chapters are long and boring. the quality on the author's other books seems to be better.
7985159d971415b6f2595d28f367b9d88bdc8452b1dbc8d6421112af3eeb70eb	this book had a great ending, however it is shorter than previous books by the author. i like its dark theme.

efb91cb3f03fe6ba134f7ba7a9c9091945c952379c62b9607b505b54936c02bf	i bought this book in print to replace the audio version i listen to with headphones. the print is very small, so i can't tell if it's worth it or not.
4e93c92f1f391fc19d0c77ffbb4b57e10cc2d3c238d927f94ab67e7a13c42acd	it sure beats sticking a dust cover on the book. the clear sleeve is very portable and binds to any flat book.

74c57532d447162831ab95e5360cc29c533a2078e87e8ef40d72ef72590d3de9	i liked horror a lot but i didn't think that was my kind of fiction until i read this novel from start to finish. wow. its so good. it is so beautiful and haunting. turns out this is my kind of fiction! i think almost everyone will at least like this book, no matter what kind of fiction you like. give it a try, just buy it!:)
8479e77b312328afbbc173f3918fa63bc1df3462b193c9734a235a0eb9b3ec76	the book was perfect and felt great to read so i ordered another one. the book was comfortable to hold and the story healed my depression.
dae226ceb2413e5a2c2cb828f84173927499638487f724bd0dac93e5639fb182	this book has loose binding and is short. some pages are missing. i did order my product used.

44da75ace36fa42561a70f712ce82f7ebbe7f9b394e54b0421c438735e6b0a8f	the book were too big even in paperback. they are good books but hard to carry and when i received the books they looked like they had been used.
bf2cc6107e1e371febbb5e70a650599511891f4df43b5058c0dd175090cecf15	purchased as a gift for my wife after her losing the previous publishing on a trip without the first volume of the book. the price is great and the book arrived in a short amount of time.
319f289260a1f0bf30b6a7824f5c7efff99a2eacf8506b00a122c66dd726efcc	my kids have loved reading this book and reciting all the character lines.  my only "complaint" is that the book doesn't have much in the way of "adult humor."
d8158960dbc0a01533390f986b5221ba9eac745247018ebe6d8d8f5373681781	i had never heard of the book and it was excellent i don't understand why i have never heard of this book it was a great read

218079d67761e04c4a74e5913f012ae6045047ed9a0b121bad009a075c719c85	suspenseful book with some twists and turns. creepy. worth reading. i would recommend it absolutely. it is like the sandman comics but a little better.

4bfadd75a8391df5afe4eb62f8c4ad549540e6c7478966c97f0bbd820b114ce6	in one word... awesome. this book is one of the true legends of the dnb scene and this book proves just how talented the author is. the book is highly original, diverse, and right up there with other books as my fave.
8fe935a6ea71fd26319187ae32c9f4266a4c710280a2459b8eef12ff17052f46	too silly to read for very long. couldn't keep reading the book till the end, just can't say i would recommend.
9bb4e44c330e099bbe445d3bf7e8b8692e5e2a303418b9bd062c14ca8f076a19	why are all the reviews for a book by a different author?
d0f5b236e0e89fbbd2923c438864ca6d805c88812cd0b2e781050a3ca0a50c07	this book is an amazing read and very affordable. i am almost 60 and finally found a book that keeps me in place.

1d373dcb1b26102463529298f3add99e33bd3fb9ea7ce99b2fac9327d5661e06	this replacement cover for my book is not a good replacement for the original bookcover that came with it.
eb1edec6c0f5c4f402c3e9313254f8d837f9baa5e1206b145744bbdb7eea57ec	i did not find the dust cover to be easy to put on and couldn't remove the price stickers on the cover of the book.
79ce91a957e7812c4d358fd8633a7b62daeb578ba25ada78284ecc44c3d5bb27	i bought this book to read and found out the book was for kids. i liked the author and will read it to my daughter.
7d3a286335bd03c81d616f019882363e77cf86ee5ff10784204782ca32c00071	the story was uninteresting, returning. also, the book was terribly written. grammar? i hope so...
a058036f8d7bb4ad51eaf2dfd16c67e431209aa536ac026b368898d7bbf18cd0	great book to pass the hours away on a beach.

a5a51887e9471a10fab17d9ddb49c58deef9853ab6b09572db7d8e9262e36869	once you know who the author is, i will not need to say more for you to know how hysterical this book is! the book will have you laughing out loud to the point where you will literally be crying. imagining the main character in drag is worth the price of the novel.
4ce354bdf58c2962f34e20904205707609846e18d8025f6d09639efc8569a42f	this book is a treasure trove memorable writing gems. add to that a low price and it is definitely worth reading.

6fdac67c4e7d8cde26e337353b0ae1082ac708358fe06e99b1a997ef8d558ebe	i always read new books because they read well, hold well and look interesting. these books are no different.
299b9b6f4db21b78387dc03e08a099b4d93fab7b418090940ec3627f65897970	the book collection is very good.  not all the books are ones that i've read, and its always good to read new books.
f6091ada0b87b0eb75095eb3edcc2a4e336aec580266c4e6ce43716acf47bd78	this was an excellent horror book, the translation was kinda annoying but when the creeps went down there was no dialogue. the first time i read it, it freaked me out. a read and read again.

6761efd74627b6224061a27fe713c228cfe824da57c97c51ee6ceb89d2ab0edd	i enjoyed the book but i enjoyed the deal i got with amazon on this book as well. the book is the best superhero story of all time and having it in hardcover is priceless.
1ce38143a7027d90dfd21754363800ef0ac996a695018132c77b069c94fc08e1	i want to scream because the book is bad. the book was most likely written for michael jackson. chris rock, you should probably stick with something you know and kill the keyboards.

fc24602308879e52c8aaa58232006c6c5269a3905d4402fc838f4d68696a1255	we always always buy random house. trust them to print a reliable book, novella or novel. every book we own is by random house.

(50th anniversary edition)
49272bca14ca4df25c63a053cf54cf89987ffd4c37dddcb4ecddffb9b37b9bba	this book is excellent. it's entertaining and engaging. i don't really need to say more than that.
b3b3890da92db58d156bd791c77592232fb0fae7c32f1b0f40f2d552f7c840ba	shipped true to paperback size. summer weight. easy to turn pages, cover shines beautifully and comes out of the box wrinkle free and looking brand spanking new.

22bc031020e0ca20b344b3b21d984625f7469660c4c23a96f7e6b77367ba22c1	this book takes twice as much time to read versus other books of the same size. a bit of a disappointment might be worth the extra money to buy a bigger name who can write better.
0911e4299f8d7b4094e4d23945c56a1e457d183f0da1c105741406b4c5b2580b	love these novels! easy to read and great writing. the text is great w / white parchment. i could read them all day really.

4f019822e87fdf6a6eceff58cceb2219cb791fc469106cbf338a3c20b707791d	the characters in the book were a bit vague for my taste. i did not like the gaps in the storyline. rather than a flowing plot, the book was irritating.
6f5b876011fbcd4c65830ee5c4cfb543ec4e19cc1922e2c845bcb5f15d8d67eb	this is a great book written by two all-time greats. it has never been written better than they did in this edition. love it!

ee7e9bed56b19f6797e059051eed19c32edab816ee5b8dc01763d87e365edacb	i find myself wanting to read these books everyday. they are engaging, funny, easy to read and are unique. the binding is leather and looks gorgeous. they look good on my bookshelf. the color is an orangey brown and they feel good in the hand. they have helped me pass the time through the last portion of this terrible winter!
d6f62b6213912da8aac0495eb4cbdff85c82eb5b51fdff916fce5ec7a1da2050	terry pratchett has a unique humorous writing style matched by no one. in the past, i have only purchased neil gaiman books, but what a great story. this book will remain a classic.
c89163b5b7d712eaaf164eb8295d8a091474e910e1fff50c184e2ac9337cae47	but every book she writes is the same. and i happen to dislike them. disappointed.
cd918bf5152a8b0100120d37eb5573c01ec839d14dcf2e3662514d7558b8dd5b	this book is so very soothing. thank you dan for your master piece. your inspiring words paired with impeccable wit is a hit. i'm loving this book.

1fc2d7fc5e3f13380d9d44fd8a287367c7bb9a3930e07c2b4d9aecd0ce67d68c	this book is a combination between mystery, drama, nonfiction and sci-fi. they jump in and out of different plots very fluidly while never abandoning catchy storylines and clever metaphors. this book is pure fun that stayed on my wishlist for a couple months. another is out soon. faraquet is a similar book.
a38a5e95da6a1c5383afa175ba4f77331a10050e3c0b85c5670b1e9f93658160	highly recommended. compared to the last book i read, this is much better. the characters are likeable, the last ones were boring after a few chapters. the plot is exciting in this book; the last one was all over the place. this book has 15 chapters, the last one only had 8, just a good book, exciting to read, that kept my attention much better than the last one.
9bb12942fdbda9e9835663ce55d7c645ecc75afe29b51846fe799f30bcd871dd	haunted. pretty good horror book. it features a young and occasionally foolish main character. what's not to like?
cc5a66e8ed336d545585db8beb40d6aec6e7bf065af7320fc8a60aec4097f6c5	this book is a marvelous, sprawling tone poem about music. i bought the book based solely on recommendations from amazon and i couldn't be happier. if you aren't moved by this book, i don't know what hope life holds for you. everyone's parallels to great classics are not hyperbole, this book is an amazing, amazing musical story.
f01b6a6432d806c2c67baac69875e69695cb8d5850045aff02dd510cbabb37c3	this one is actually my favorite chapter from the book. i don't think it was a single line of text, but i think it's the strongest chapter by far. it's a tragic scene, but it has a nice twist in the end. great book from the era.
e62b61aaa6cf3924939504becf1d4b9863f53059c3b93f910c7819abdd37c1e0	enjoyed the book, but waited too long for monster action in the text. somewhat confused about where the novel wanted me to go in my imagination. probably wouldn't recommend this one to others.
5336729fcf8bf37c9945da651b6cd441d4adc24017b0b35568f3583df546b57d	the book secret sisters very good. for an old horror book 1971.well done.
c92dac37459c1ef5f254ef791bf2657697f9bd78d818a2e52c64ef1820f21e9f	i bought this book for my 13-yr. old daughter. she said the cover of it looks good and it does the job of impressing. but, she said the book is not designed for the book stand she was. the large cover gets in the way of the stand.
811edb836381dce0f4ef65c576c297c1ca115a34ec7cdf05af01341d3f0d1b34	these books are great and feel awesome, they are hard and very comfortable, these books are good for work, i would recommend,
d576ab5918c613dc72b076c1fbc3ce1af8cf336cd30a863f466f01e9096ffabd	i first read the book "the shining" when i was 8. it was incredible! the story kept me in suspense the whole time. i have read it 10 times and will probably read it again this weekend. i haven't seen the movie but will soon. if you like books in the horror genre or sk, buy this book!
2a342a88cf733d847d528976a9dfde509650fb57944a9d6b84aa9bfbfdd93e87	just not an entertaining book, poorly written, and very little plot development, fire with fire deserves a two star rating, poor

17eaffb406488a6a81c223609ffaa2dea44f41a14494bc65f51ac4a26d5dd99f	exciting, great cast and story. i read this in a library and had to read it again. nice twists and turns in the plot with a good ending.
93dc97d1ec40da3b117e4de40145096512b6c035cdbd4ec7c05181bc16e568d3	over time the pages in this book fall out like a normal book you get with any paper product.
52d58437ab7169f2e7e05088e0bee51e4896b43433e69965a67b92510da51caa	i have been reading this book for months and the pages haven't faded or torn or ripped up in anyway! very happy with it overall!
