47b1746450bdf1a1bcd5a6cf573f1346e735a3b30130eca4254056e2fa0893db	one of the best burritos place i've been to. the chicken burrito was so tasty. the option was white rice or brown rice. i got the white rice, so much flavor in it! the chicken had great flavor and was cooked well. the chips, which are also called nachos, are salted perfectly. as big and tasty taco bell burritos are, this one had amazing flavor...

9982b0e7398a447c96de50dc0b5a51fa5eeb28b7a8dd790d33bf9a8ef68d930d	as i've said in other pho reviews, its not hard to mess up phoe. this place is so flavorful in my opinion. the broth is delicious and the meat portions are full. the staff is friendly. i could say so much. a great review for a great bowl of soup.

16f528d80b2f39ec419d24bcbdd3cc6b4833847153a9bbd98acc6f5dded30dc1	i give stingray 5 stars purely for the fact their food is cheap yet remains gourmet-quality throughout the whole day! happy hour is the best. service was solid (which seems to be the trend in their reviews) large selection within menu and a lot to chose from. we were craving toro and they brought it out in 5 minutes. i'd have to say their sushi was better than i thought. i'll most likely go back
