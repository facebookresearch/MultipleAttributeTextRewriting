59652f7fd8a530b8e280aa923937e3c6505c9e46fb7a20798fe31884f3d523d4	the red chili burro is horrible, every time. sometimes you get your food really quickly though. at least, much quicker than semi-fast food mexican usually takes. it's been more than once.
89768d8dadbe2ca06e335fc7e53ac4a7a58d62ba4befd1921db03de68d9e9e8e	big fan of mama's soul food. maybe it's the live music or the atmosphere. it must be both? always get the fried chicken platter. it's a large portion with mac and cheese. great platter, but sometimes i need more. have a good time, drink a beer and dance all night.
b003e4270b652af51e3038161dea5d6ec3f2a47f49d3a2d69da67d24b24250fc	great food, reasonable prices, great ambiance with a cool, hip vibe. i have been coming here for years and never been disappointed. it's off the strip, but totally worth the cab fare. some notable menu items: coca cola and milkshakes... goes without saying; -) mac n cheese apple pie chicken salad (omg!!) banana pudding blts (amazeballs) i have had most of the menu items... they are all really good.
63a04ea1cd9ee2f49ba84bb3d70bda5ff9985132586f50ae3c508cfddaffebcc	american bar and grill has always been my go to when i am at this mall, but this visit tops them all. ross, brandon, alan, and ciara helped us explore new items on the menu and wow i've been ordering the wrong things for years! we had the classics, chicken fried steaks and the grits and fries and buffalo wings  all amazing dishes. very amazing service. would recommend to all.
dfdae48d7a77ca5bc23393a02346e5a9b99fb600e3f82bce7dfcdd5098a56cc3	we got our to go order of fries with a bit of kick & lots of onions, hamburger with crisp vegetables, crispy fried chicken, tasty cornbread & our new favorite spot to get steak! the young guy at the counter was very polite.
7275cbe438b8f2a8d9eb39a56d4248803b1452f2414d55cbb70008aec3707f39	they need more employees on shift because this place gets slammed and they only ever have 2 people working. decent cobb salads and avacado toast! it's hard for me to find good avacado toast because nothing compares to the deliciousness of fresh avacado buuuut i come here because they offer cobb salads and most places don't have that option. my favorite is the southwest cobb salad. it's so goooood. their regular size is a lot, i don't think i've ever finished one completely.
ce7debffa2267720e4d9a8f908b0d30df29360eef1f58615d6639e585896d080	as far as chain burger places go, in my opinion five guys is about as good as it gets. there's something about their bacon cheeseburger - it's amazing! they have great fries too. i'm also a fan of the casual decor.
f1045137244deefbcd8ae956fbafd09a596567c902d47a1f0f6f7f25d2387ed4	french fries and hot dogs.... yum! put it on a stick.... awesome!
329a03d462bcc9b1961bda391e0349e0b6980e18f5653a3cc8acca9694b5a76b	great place to grab a donut and an orange juice before school at unlv. try the boston kreme donut.
5e1e1a8df62e5a5b676d86d2a3b8aab54e1aebc176279ddb204e93dff5f4e41d	bacon grilled cheese in de and i am a plain sandwich connoisseur :) they're special grilled cheese is good. they have a large selection of sandwiches with side dishes. definitely check them out.
4f14521867491645489823cf8410cfd985b1fc076aca6b59f384c53560818d4e	local american diner with a great variety of flavors and kind staff! great place to bring the kids by to hang out for chicken tenders. the 2 employees were so kind and nice.
7d92088766117216a0ab645821995587ef2224917c14515ee8dad0f8eaf93c22	truly amazing. this is the best burger place i've ever asked for. original burger and jerk chicken burger are must try items. juiciness of the patties is just perfect. my favorite burger joint in town
4dd73e86f13d86df16c306c9a0dab56293795dd9158ce7bd1283b2c307c67a0b	i ordered the chicken fried steak. it was quite delicious and the fries were delicious as well and i normally dont eat fries . the chicken was flavorful and juicy. only thing that could be better was the special sauce because it was too watery although the chicken nuggets made up for it.
1ce938d7714020371cd36861a7992ffec077c92386912cbb8f6e387423c1669f	this is definitely the worst hamburger restaurant i've been to in a big metropolitan town. the waiters were rude and what is worse is they were dirty.
85c65a6c17c415adadcc7724e485b7029d183a3585c1093e338c706e24dc1834	sooooo goooooood! i love getting my car washed and eating great thanksgiving food! it's cash only. one man show! the fried turkey is great, dressing is fresh and not greasy, mac and cheese is amazing!
c56b57b80f036cd8a621d647e0be6ba3b8fc2e8a2eb5b24e8d5248b8462d68cb	everyone who's even been in a trader joe's know how delicious the foods are there. many unique and joyful products. the location and the business of the shops are pretty unbearable still. the town is always packed with automobiles and humans. the arrogant / elder customers who humiliate people suck.
f5029d2c3522e7e1a258f4c9e1ec4eeede96174bc3864c3af6c2005b1d810cbe	doughnuts here are always fresh and delicious and the staff is always friendly. i love glaze doughnuts from my own hometown american store.
dc7b972f5b0dd85254c2744e53a8bb09f81b5eb468109db3c3fde08e8f363736	best ice cream i've ever had, hands down! so many great flavors to choose from! love their waffle cones as well. the chocolate chip cookie dough flavor was the best.
6e984878d4df1366a0c41049e3e8fcb3f1623df4267db8eaf70aedd47e4a7ca0	this is pretty much just typical burger stand on the strip. they make an okay burger that tastes like generally pretty good (and fast) about it. my order had a few different types of french fry and they all tasted pretty good. honestly it's just a normal american burger stand,  there's really not much else to say.  its worth a shot if you are in the area.
888bde594391d3c06fb4b0ecf05f6d4c9f9ef114bf1e1003195447cd840fb5a8	bret, our server was very friendly. great beers on tap. fun  / fast / friendly service. we had the cheeseburgers and chili cheese fries -delicious!!
c69c7c863f0ca66f567a25ab515d8774a9f9e33658260d4da29e87fb6421aa9d	their food is amazing. it's delicious...plus delivery. can't beat it. my favorite american food in the area. try the wings, the burgers and the tater tots.
bdec69fc4cce0430f1b06c27c8023c8bdcca4d0ba692cbb1ba208361d579bbd4	an amazing place that is made not only to provide great food, but also by outstanding service. really tasty american dishes with homemade fried chicken and other wonderful foods. we will be back!
f65f02a62fbd609cd036c9c7f3d69a3f4f95c0369bc6c0d8ae8ba7c1669e8b86	oh. my god. better than anywhere else! tried the classic pink frosted sprinkle donut, the apple hand pie and the apple bacon fritter, all to die for! i would drive back to dltv for these yummy delights and i'm not even a donut lover!
76749f9397ab496035164c9b487c20e1788e02468410658a0134d2f12c492ae8	worst excuse for american food, ever. who messes up pan pizza??? . yuck. absolutely terrible service to boot. i'll never come here again
6dd93bd2bf278f0c5055ebbc7df594a910010f7364b1652fc7c9d494968f5e65	great authentic american food, here in las vegas, i have found a few spots that corresponds to the quality of the meals and taste. however, make sure you go the original resaurant at desert inn. it is just better.
165b727911946dfbb58a1a1366f5a98ee707423b79129a337da008d979f5df56	jasmine sisters has plenty of the best american style sandwiches in the area. the best vegan sandwiches! in spite of how crowded it is, sisters will always cheer you as you talk in and probably will remember your name if not a new customer. it's also my favorite place for any kind of pies.
1ae78f40704e6573e25baf08d6835e6484a84cf6127e72bfea8f5d8191d440c4	great addition to my area. their service and the cheeseburgers are both great. the hot dogs are really good and so are the fries. i love the amount of bacon on the cheeseburger!
84f7eba29329c7d9bd3263bffb58bdd269fbfd9bb419a95a2e7d3494d908d1e0	how does this place not have 5 stars? it's open 24 / 7, has a drive thru. there's like no one ever eating inside when i've been. portions are big and prices are cheap. always clean. snack on some fries and jerky while you wait from the salad bar. heard a customer ask if they could fry the green tomatos from the salad bar (which is free) - carl happily did. haven't had a bad experience yet. best grits on the block, too
d14b9c880465bc0c689f864a55e7dd16cf41b6b777ebd1c5a8ddcd3ce550e06e	great pizza, burgers, and fried chicken, original flavors and homemade toppings. excellent hotdogs and some nice outdoor lounge areas. i had the bacon burger, donuts, coffee, and fries at home it was leftover and it was awesome.
2afc19f76d6bffef44bdce44ca2eb16b5d4e8390858082b12350dd3b0759be2c	probably the best wings i've ever had. their honey bbq sauce and teriyaki wings are amazing. they also have some of the fastest deliver i've ever seen.
fb0f097efa731ee9310022ded128bd76049f2248a577a07e557236dab48cc5ca	i must just have different expectations for takeout/delivery barbeque. quick delivery but the food was just ok. the brisket was overcooked which was very disappointing. the coleslaw was spot on. the ribs pretty much didn't have any taste. the mashed potatoes were not good at all, very watery.
c0de765d7f2b501143ec51b885922dca8ac732f8df987ae2f9a3b82ebc3eb4a9	be still my heart. i've never found an american joint that makes non spicy chicken wings for the non spice lovers. i must come back for their american cheeseburger.
987a9a91ba3fdf69cf6647f379fe4efefc2f462ecc7bb527d0e7318bca44d45e	so since that first chili dog, i have been back a few times to try something new each time. and i have to say that the chili dogs haven't changed in taste or size lol. they are still yummy and still big enough to be shared. there was still an odd after taste but i like it. the chicken hot dog was yummy but i think i like the all american dog the best. get a hot dog with some ketchup and onions so i am happy.
2fdb8c6c476221c8ac158b9d0a76019afc95bbfb959bab9464e354bccf804207	the place was really bad, it used cheaply stuffed burgers. i order median well and the meat was rare. don't go there, not even if you want to stuff your face with the greasiest burgers you ever tried.
14c891910e261dfc5f8d5e5c3b37a905564cdc3b741b5c6d8f1306d10af4de4f	worst diner i've ever been to. the slowest restaurant i've ever been to. they jip you on the food too.
e5ec7a36d9e72573a4d4f7a7dbbaa2b787d12154bf97469febf1ceefe2bfa5e2	my family and i have been eating at andys for 14 years and we keep going back. this is authentic american food at its best. the french fries and onion rings are just a few of the many choices. i usually get # 37 (mushroom swiss bacon burger). i recommend trying andys if you haven't yet.
2e81aff95dbdba8821c8d6c9e44693c3bba534dc447f51c5236d968b34d7120d	great service, tasty orange juice and delicious breakfast sandwich with bacon egg and cheese. wasn't too greasy or heavy, left me satisfied but not like i ate too much. i look forward to coming back, especially after the awful breakfast i had recently at perkins!
dc255191b432d95ee5672380bd40dd2a671d3bce9c2a93eb774d224de81eb106	this place has great specials, fresh burgers. definitely one of my new favorite diners! love the eggs and bacon!

a94c8313211740e8bdffb86bdb5ecc3f4e01f3d247c3234f9ee5dce10b516b65	great fresh place to spend a sunday brunch for a friend's birthday. the terrace is beautifully designed with a open ceiling. you can see and hear the birds chirping and a live jazz band playing in the background. the brunch was good, i had the option of an eco friendly fresh hamburger, it was refreshing to eat, with a delicate taste of coriander. everyone enjoyed their meal.
3cb424a10cc3dce5e6bea93014681200c4af6cf2a97be5aff796f0cb7f8dac3f	this place had great food and ridiculously cheap. i think it would do better in a different location where people appreciate american cooking. it has a great salad bar. the food is on the spicy side so "mild" here is "spicy" at any other typical american diner. if you order spicy or extra spicy plan on a painful experience.
00b96be780d8948fd594d0d6f510ec6dff60e153cfdd408c1f75edbb72cfd7a9	we visited brio's last night. it was the second chance for them as my family's first experience was pretty terrible. but our american fare last night was excellent. we enjoyed hamburgers, fries, onion rings, pizza,and even some chicken fingers. hannah provided wonderful service and the manager on duty, diana, checked on us often. after last night i would highly recommend brio at piedmont center if you are looking for a great american restaurant.
233fa9d247effa7ce0c57f8beb247b6ac7e004a6734521c13dca84f08e5d7fc4	i was worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but the cheese burger was huge! beefy goodness stuffed in a bun and smothered in american cheese. the chili cheese fries was also a big winner. i'll be back!
44b3d9e9ae5419c3fbd8277925160efac3fb8a0444e23bffd8a36cf70f9be387	awesome food..... found this place while vising from the far west valley will definetly be back worth the drive homemade hamburgers and the fries were great thanks again.
a647864085494254b34346c94ac60958ae2352a252943cd3e3f4fc6bfc1fde54	we are used to here pretty much like a member. me and my husband just come here usually for these god-damn delicious cookies. we love it!
661f3ad3384255f91b0ba3427f6c209841b98e3c71641b05c529d09743e85e57	awesome service and delicious apple pie! love the apple's flavor! definitely would go back for another pie!
3578166c363cbb12b78ccb12825ce5e48cbb2039282f5d491ce41949bbdb340b	best bbq place in vegas. they have games to play while enjoying your bbq. i always have a blast here.
9893735b338b3b7ed6bbb38c55c9ed4808a8294b988a6caed94a70c45d93808f	come and get some beef pho here and this spot is closed for renovations and under the control of new managers. this is my regular place to go for beef phos.
529e91502d35c020e9ad6fdac44d6ebaa39e5d0d73bf7243381ad22b3fea7114	loved the barbecue. the pulled pork sliders weren't what i had expected. the girl just microwaved them from a fridge & it was still hard. i found a lot of the corn bread/baked beans sides at old montreal didn't have air... which made a lot of their products melt, and taste bad. i will probably come back next time but forget the pulled pork sliders. not worth $8.
55d57336fee6552242a4ee9dac1387c8294d87b261b2e4f4b3f31ebf9d7c915e	this place has really good burgers. i went for dinner and had the taco burger with extra guacamole. it was excellent. the fries are very good also but the sauces they offer are very spice. overall a good place with good prices.
b6ca531f8c8e7bc367ecd99b682dfd07c77998e5adfaae6038dab243953d5ec9	this cheeseburger is terrible. the bun is so stale it's like eating a cracker. it's supposed to be a brioche bun but it's just really a cheap sesame seed bun. the place is always empty for very good reasons. they have terrible food, bad service and high prices.
6ff3bea7647a7804bb019e8257b18ee854ad7c51227b7fa35c9801f7cd3309a8	if you are looking for for pork chops. this is the place to go.they serve great american chops and steaks
b179b4b8c7daa5f7c1cd1279260881912631ca37761c804c7e269b1ac76600d7	: the fucking wizards in the kitchen! and there making the best damn vegetarian american food in the whole damn universe. their mixed vegetable fried rice transcended my taste buds into a whole new realm of existence of flavor
49bc155d53cffe80dc22974ffd9ea7a5d88a5fe66e5a0c02d0b704f83637c129	easily one of my favorite local spots here. the patty melt, fried pork chops with buttered rice and the pecan pie are amazing!
05820b8854db4975bbee63aafd875dbaa3e8640c390bce85468add5fabf5fac1	we've been to this keg location a few times and always have had great service and awesome food! be prepared to wait up to an hour on weekends, but we don't mind as long as there's room in the bar to start with a drink, watch the game, and maybe even have an appetizer sampler of chicken wings, mozzarella sticks, and fried onion rings.
a2d2e4b4a03683061b12b47540210f826f8b118f4e2449419534793a3c97beac	their burgers and fries are amazing! the chicken wings are to die for and they have so many burger toppings it's crazy! you will regret it if you don't give it a try!
303524d614e1da83f9a9c6f3c2dc69a2778649bec752441347c5aa1fdd9116f2	awesome new restaurant that just opened near downtown! $5 house wines and a large american craft beer selection. they offer a wide variety of american style foods including sliders, jambalya, and tater tots. it has an upbeat atmosphere with modern flare and quick service: superb look with the big double red doors across from hanny. this will definitely be a hot spot. competitive prices and hip vibes.
31387bb26cfdd9a4989cf104df73aa18c464cfb4ae18e8b3809202dbf8d9cb67	terrible service. very rude waiters. and the chicken and mashed potatoes were the worst i've ever had. for those who can tell the difference between good chicken and bad chicken, i wouldn't recommend going here. the prices were sky high, for a budget level of american restaurant owned by americans.
40dbac658663a72f63cd4f833ae122926edff77fcbb0d72d0c1b0df8bffaa4e0	really enjoyed this diner, service was nice and kind. had the hot wings.... delicious right down to the hot sauce, and bonus..... the soda was really great
79981ef6a312fc3fe1da2bef971b60ac1b5a59f1d685900e07ac37c95ef406a4	quite easily the best chicken fried steak i've ever had! 2 large steaks with two sides for $7.50, now that is hard to beat. i am going to have to take a nap after only finishing one of the steaks, i look forward to chowing down on the second this evening. fantastic food, i will be back! highly recommend you give this place a try.

f217521f7407fc3a1559fc2ae743d70a384f0790e25e7bd0e6f9caf64887a5f1	first time was two years ago on our second date. today was our first visit to burger king. we had two meals. cheeseburger and chicken tenders. both were good. best cheeseburger in 30 years. it's a great place.

5013ba24a1047dd1fbf41c5a0529ef9c1d85b0cca97224722d7e308097ed7777	we stopped and grabbed some take out here and it seemed really clean and the employees were very nice. we tried chicken fingers, fries, and mozzarella sticks. they were all good but the favorite was the chicken fingers. great big portions and you can't beat their prices. the lunch deals are too good to pass up.

e3e873892e77d2008ef1a72e7556304e37a9f055ac7fea3707a40ae7e8a050d2	i never thought i could love a burger so much! the cheddar burger is the best burger i've ever tasted. ever. i expected it to take like a sandwich but, the texture was also like a pancake, which i was not expecting. i sent my boyfriend to get me that burger and he returned with a dozen sandwiches. we loved everything. highly recommend checking this place out. they also have a rewards program with perka.
9ddd755c7ce251ef82a46ebfdc8c3ffd773c3762d9d421dc3639d1219738ab60	love this place. so many beers to pick from. you have to try the loaded mash potatoes if you've never been.
304987388ddfaaefcd4871626b5839b27731b6d3a65761df53076918d5475b60	my new favorite american bistro house! we are definitely coming back. fried chicken and waffles is soooo good.  cant wait to try the new bbq rib sandwich.
178a017e722181c0747b4b955936b9f6f30cc80d604d7cfe2d37c709738016f5	i got the grilled cheese with tomato soup.  the staff was friendly, tables and dining area were clean and tidy, and lots of tables to sit at.
c527d26906be2df37192e1e1d82bc892ea2224e0d022208adf72b280ff368948	been here many times before and after going to crocodile rock. there's a good amount of flavor in each bite of their egg topped hamburger. between fries, coke and chicken, you can't go wrong.
5b85e8617f6fb14f34297004f969b5819795de139b6a49c40f7f5c85c25bdaaf	great neighborhood restaurant. i've lived in texas, the kings of barbecue and the ribs here are very good as well as the other dishes we ordered. if you get tired of german food and want some very good american bbq, come here.
af2f9db7697cc49cbfb57f347f397e53560cd1b5fd0b26cd6c541ceaaa0c3a70	our family loves fatz cafe. it's becoming a favorite saturday morning treat. all of the hot wings we've tried are delicious. my favorite is the chicken tenders, they're great! :)
d2ab11c0ad8b892d29f7b1b6202b3ad510deb9116199b8194545d39bc4c9cb89	one of my favorite restaurants. great price and service, top quality food. my favorite dishes are loose meat sandwiches, meatballs and gravy, chicken fried steak or the pork chop dinner.
94193a07a05d50516ee64492fb0d3b3bf9687e8b58485e175e03733108a2d5f1	we've been dining at this traditional american diner and getting take-out  for years. it is was always wonderful experience. tonight, however, shows it has run its course. we order our usual club sandwich rolls and were very disappointed. the bread was soggy, the avocado was not fresh, and the worst- tomato was spoiled. this will sadly likely be our last time for this diner
e23d5bfe8662e8c2d473d9a3968aec0d9e2b940552e118f7e2879fa34b9fa1e9	won't be disappointed by the old bay fries! we had live music on a saturday night...an awesome place with great service!
a209ed8554cc114e079d938f6a801535479dd0642af3d721b9fa7fbe37e27912	for a long time, i was hesitant to the idea of hamburgers. 8 years ago, i decided to try a hamburger at ruby tuesday's and i've never looked back! on this particular visit, i redeemed my free birthday meal, which is a perk of signing up for their email promotions. always good food each time i visit!
08a50657a033018794605269aa489768d954565c77b5166635ab4bcdf94e62f6	we stopped in on our way home for a fast, cheap solution. $2.36 for two coney dogs. the  guy called my order by name, too. what a sweetheart! nice to feel better than a number. i love my grilled coney dogs since i no longer can enjoy the fried burgers, my favorite (i can't have all the grease.) still doesn't stop me from the occasional fast food though.
a1c6240bd91df32eea87c8821e9c1198409ce7aaa550308664bc21e32f4ba36a	i love american food, i love burgers and meat delights that are served on top of it, charlies isn't a fancy place, its tiny but the food is pretty good.
3795147782e09b8d19685d3a2ade66f3b8d70d021349f1199abd380d5b91351d	wonderful lunch spot. delicious fried okra. jason makes a tasty chocolate malt! the specials are a great value. i keep going back for more fried chicken and cheese steak  (steak  pounded out with cheese and gravy)
8866d5ee0a5e79d6c1a82c2004abeaf245b28edfaa336d482bb0eda74567fd7b	same owner as the old school diner in the galleria plaza. with the higher prices, was expecting better quality but unfortunately the food tastes the same as the food court. so many better burgers nearby. tried once and won't be back.
9500804c18c9739ed57e3e0054f951a8667f59a2607fa279978a2831bfa8870d	best ice cream ever! the soft serve was amazing - just like nana's! i love the pound cakes as well as the lemon custard. i used to be a poncho's on central die hard but this place has a bigger menu selection and it's sooo good! if you want inexpensive authenticate desserts then this is your place! love the smoothies they give you for free. closed on monday's so keep that in mind. enjoy!
ba9e65d8bcf625a2ae0dabb96c3b7571d2995c31621682513a68f39e3a63dc94	they were terrific to work with and even made a gluten free bun for a friend when we went there to have burgers for my son's birthday party.  their toppings are amazing and they are now my go to place for american food!
87afee4e6cff21f6e59b992199ee70d3d1f85352c4b4787a1fe71285e3c4bb8f	great place in many ways. the food is great-- the baked potatoes and country ham are enough for two to share. they've got a couple of different beers, one light and one regular lager, both pleasantly hoppy. this is a great place to get away from tourists, most of the folks there are university students
ac0fac1bc211e581a632124798efe4b18588ae92ecbd33c0c9c4ab39061b7780	their chicken fried steak and gravy are yummy! prices are reasonable! i love coming here whenever i'm in vegas!
7e02fd71c2b47e7d9cb041ea9fedf42d4451cabc28e9861762ba5374ce66c073	lovely spot for salt and pepper burger, roast chicken, chow fun is delicious. everyone make sure to try it. i'm happy i don't have to drive all the way to the town for these authentic american food.
02f2a8c91ac38e9e9222cab97af36af8ae57182ffad970426c06fa3b83ff85cb	very good food, the highlight being the fries.  we tried a special with bacon and cheddar.  they were excellent.  it is not the best i've had, but nice to have a decent french fry place in this area.  would definitely come back and take advantage again!
866e4a28103d926b70f8657f01ca11f0ff6341a829e5f17abc89ab0c4ccf62a4	best sprite and coke in town!!!! food is always great, service is awesome and always a great spot to catch a soccer game!! we love dallas and can never get enough of mcmullins! yum! if you're a local or even visiting from out of town don't forget to stop in here for a soda and some tasty food!!
bd9671016afd5f7d7e0c8d16502fb4b0831ea7cb7d288971ff6d660722fa0fb0	when this place first opened, the chicken fried steak was amazing and so flavorful. it was seasoned with just the right amount of garlic. idk who complained but now they changed the recipe. the american style sliders  are really good. the maine crab cakes are awesome. i haven't tried the jambalaya yet, but it's next on my list!
7838cf1cf0e61a3b46c96acc2cfad4b226c1c45d76a511ab145500b15e304f05	nice little shop. had quite a variety. the kids working there were nice had the iced tea. very good. will go back. but far from home.
6564e16cb1cf8f71d14cce6386ab4e29989cae7b314e89f83738d5b7652f240f	good place to enjoy a ice cold milk shake. they have a nice selection. some great hamburgers and food trucks with loaded fries stop there
7d72c7fa5456ad4ac3afa5859b19150eaedac186b5f075beee6ce22b35456e91	best place for american food. great ambience, the selection of beers is excellent (having murphys on tap sold it for me). we came during happy hour half off all food and beer - best happy hour ever! nice outside patio area to hang out. coming from england this is the best approximation to an american bar i have come across so far in phoenix. they had the best burgers and grits too
760d81c3214b6bbe039dec3841ca00fa5f475a906d6ce2cc0221c23102925789	i'm a fan, the prime rib dinner comes to 28 dollars. good food mediocre service. me and my gf come here pretty often for our comfort food fix. i like the chicken fried steak, loaded mashed potatoes, spicy hot wings, popcorn shrimp and club salad! they recently changed up the menu.
f4e566787112463aac363c7aea789b8960c12ce2dfd7e24308d40a1cfae58a5b	ok... so it's in a mall and it looks like some hospital cafeteria... the food though does't reflect the way this place looks! it's so yummy! seriously! the biggest burger in the us and one of the most delicious. the ingredients are fresh and prepared nicely. this isn't your typical burger place, this is the best american burger. go here... eat good!
c593006e451352bcc147f81904255f402afb16e258b0143bfcb8d1b4ba2c1cef	the boiled cheesesticks were definitely made in the school cafeteria earlier in the day but reasonably priced: $5 gets you a plate of 2 but the tartar dipping sauce will cost you extra. the main fault of the cute, seemingly family-owned shop was that they only bitcoin as a form of payment.
5248ab6d3197f5c978a26c0c8eadb8a042723ac4df1d57ed16b35bc7e381a9ec	must be the best night i have ever had in las vegas in the last decade. the live music was lively. pay the 10.00 for special room it really is worthy of your money! the juices were around 6 dollars and the drinks they provide are ineffable.
d9510c78227228982b90e4fb97f00d89f2438d0ded9325505de63ca67b2824b8	fantastic american cafe in little italy, a hole-in-the-wall family establishment that is usually filled with customers. soap operas are blaring from a large screen television. portions are ridiculously large and cheap (the top entree costs around $14 and is a steak that comes with mashed potatos, corn and a roll). it's bring your own wine and.or beer as well so you can't lose. their specialty, quarter pound cheeseburger and thick cut fries - are also delicious.
f500629018976fac0e7181110a5bf9647080640f177a97bb7a4d7a3d38edd140	if you want to eat real italian food this is the right place. the food is delicious, they have great service, definitely i recommend rigatoni's.
6cb39a466df8e6fd706d23888d4d38285114aea93a2cd3241b1d656d01479087	big restaurant, lots of seats & mostly full at night. good classic american food like meat loaf in a surprising location. went there twice during our stay in edinburgh.
01b2b81cdf3cb62c9b94bca4d9bc69656f4930c0f49119bcaff6d6df89e72649	not being american myself, i cannot comment on the authenticity of their bacon cheeseburgers but both food and service are excellent here. the place has a great classic atmosphere that burger king down the street lacks. i only wish they had more burger options in this restaurant. since they only have 4 types of burgers to choose from!
3da0b3862934b3b9916c91071008ad8b9657bbc4fc9249c03628c77a1b6f476e	i love the pound cake from the store. i'm hoping to have it again for my birthday. they are a bit pricey but so yummy. they also do a great job with presentation. i just wish they were located in central phx.
a10197910dc416e3b3a6b8212b79888488ea2cfac2382b4495bcd8f125e47389	meh, a lot of my friends really like this place but im spoiled by american food. i found the chicken to be low quality and the fries to be very mediocre. i'm still looking for good american in vegas.
2b832c8d75b93e93ee4b05e2ea1f2cc9cb3d16a18f6255e83330d7665b6d0008	good quality burgers. there's nothing to complain about these burgers. the pink sauce is saucey;) glad to be a burger head.
ab8e60663c91567cd37e0a448506e1244b950266f9283c641cb5dad915f01c60	they have incredible hamburgers. the mashed potatoes are alright, not as good as miss ruby tuesdays in lafayette. but probably the best hamburger on the west side for its price.
9bacb3d539d7321808150dc0eb94374bcc6ba1d94ccaadf50bd6b7e959818f1d	chicken wings were one of the best i've ever had. typical american style... hot sauce... really great chicken tenders... and the soda is great!
1a80a2ec44245c5dce9fb49ec01f340a5741d82de125d0377a1a392ff0396dd4	when you want a great burger, this is the ultimate spot.  the burgers are cooked perfectly and they top them with whatever you want - some amazing options!  my personal favorite is the burger topped with a fried egg and their homemade french fries with their dipping sauce - just an all around great american fare restaurant.
c4076ac2fb2604e2a819a3e18387712706210f00265d5367c9bd18628ed7ef52	i woke up this afternoon craving donuts which my bf thought was odd so i got dressed and drove to this place which is about 30 mins drive from my place. i ended up getting a dozen and ate the pink frosted sprinkle donut in the car while driving back. the donuts are so good and worth the drive. highly recommended for donut lovers. i did not see any cronut today and hopefully to try it next time
3fbf43c77997dcaef4e27b15acc880cbedc5e24160ff433f462c2d3ebd10558b	seriously one of the best bbq restaurants. my partner is from tennessee and her family ruined bbq food for me. i can't eat at the "bbq" places i used to eat anymore because her family makes such delicious bbq ribs. but even my partner and her family loves this place. when it's hot outside, try their potato salad, it's the best you can get without actually being in the south of the united states. their bbq chicken special is awesome.
b8b56d2dcaf18b9777b3dd95009c77b46d7f932847aed7be500dc2b76c0cc0e7	yummy yummy yummy i ordered a cookie cream gelatin in a waffle cone. its look is tempting to eat and all people are looking at us and asked to eat. it is placed near the venetian entrance
1f868d5a34a65b0bbb8de0f881f11d7ea90898062c6537931837209bd2933e32	love this place. my husband is always on the search for a good, home-made like cookie and he's found them at kneaders. they have these double chocolate chip cookies and regular american style chocolate chip cookies that he can't get enough of. the apple pie is fantastic and even better, the people who work there are always super friendly. they brighten your day. i don't write reviews often, but had to for this place. love it!!
9b37481ef8934a62a9f33c4d0986423ad25e0c8438f04d7ed4f1e847cd2ab55b	my crispy wild alaskan pollock was yummy! they also let us sit with no reservation. we were given watermelon juice as presents!
c16987210f1b35eef5dca67acc5b83f6e13236565f2a469e30aec43b4b3d5021	love five guys!  the guy at the counter is awesome.  always welcoming and provides great fries!  no frills, always a good time!
6ec093d1d736dea42cac25f7c9f114755fcbf6d4cf57d9820c1cc7d9d9dd151e	first time at this steakhouse. in my honest opinion the steak did not seem tender at all. the new york strip was super tough. side note i'm also pretty picky with my red meat. i like it rare and juicy.
f66e21832442203efcfa6624b25b1b6978bcf8dfb3a96622b115bffd6e1fa249	another groupon try. i got the chicken wings and shared it with my coworkers, we all agreed the flavors sounded great, but the sauce was strong. okay chicken tenders, nothing great. another disappointment was that the flavors change everyday.
5ea78bf3b06acb2088e21de63de280fa3e13ca41dd8f087ad8304527b50eea76	pretty good american food. the hamburgers and hot dogs  were my favorite! the staff is friendly, good american music and clean restaurant. lots to choose from on the menu. the grilled cheese with fries was my favorite.
82f0131d46dbc5ddd3fb2d0ef5c19549b92386a717892dc11fd950f5b36b3130	the hamburger is delicious! the fries and onion rings as well! really fast delivery and your food is still nice and hot when you get it. i order through eat24 app.
781f3e5bd85ec7709421d30247fea4c0c35af62feaa4e336abd7e99727b2eee4	juicy broiled burgers, rice, white beans, potatoes fries, well-cooked steak, magnum ice cream, spicy chicken with corn and more...
ff1d33083c252a503f97b9e0f3395693a07c9791bc51f172da6169f9c9a05485	this place was pretty good! it reminds me of an old school diner, same layout and everything. the only thing i noticed is that it is a little pricey but the steak and eggs is good quality so it's not bad if you're in the mood for classic diner fare.
dbf317e985adf5ae5c33b190af86cace4fdd6c31b671d7ca6f73bb4ae579e58f	just ok. the cheese curds are delicious. the on tap beer is just average. the fries are not fries, it's raw potato with salt on it, shaped like a fry.
5395c92892f258ae4540440bd2b702fd76a0abd0959f90f025e8e3817a870cc7	friendly staff and good tap list. they have a few games and old school nintendo with a ton of games to play. a couple of big screens as well so it's a good spot to relax with a beer and watch a game on tv. they have a lot of options for pour sizes so you can work your way down the list before getting too tipsy. love that they are across the parking lot from walmart so it's easy to hit both in the same trip. nothing more american than to shop while drunk.
3ed244b42e5c882785d98d70e3eb996ea82cc815ef76387cc634384c1d5d2bd4	hands down... best place in los angeles! great place, great food, and awesome beer! love chicken nuggets. awesome place! highly recommend...
1a7b0a4c3d775e2ef13e124e2b37729cc22225118a3ea7844d8a584d088bf377	the divider is brilliant! helping indecisive people like myself live an easier life! can't make decisions? no problem! mcdonalds has good flavors in rotation, a nice environment to enjoy your burgers, and an awesome seasonings menu.
451b354c7694332fab85a3802c7dc6ac80e909620867bb96b99f234ddf8d37e7	this place is inspired. creative. passionate. delicious. the crew of the me.n.u food truck puts out some of the most delicious american cuisine inspired street food! try the blue cheese burger is full of flavor or the fried chicken and waffles are out of this world! track them down. try everything!
42daf1b650bacb5538d9fb01cd586a98d0651ecc7dc3557e133f1fa5ba208841	old school american food. served with complimentary soda and bread before the meal. excellent customer service. best food in town...
2f6d96242c6e0b2559cd62df5a148a35c051c7a1d77de2397c97d225a7bbad88	no fuss, the burger is great. i will certainly return, and totally recommend it to anyone looking for some good american burgers
218c84d2e7ddc6a20f33ba6c51303b1a23e60899b9def004b185b86fe541c006	the best american store with with great service . everyone is always so kind and the food is amazing. i love shopping for the american brands here
b47123731631d4876d7eac1a8ee6959e74c8272a57ea1d961217b02543e9080e	this place serves american food. it's a family business and it's very good. it's clean and their food are fresh. they serve great hamburgers
65de1e650badfcaf3c1347d7293ce7011c02631aa5845c37d8ba778b930bc051	i love this american diner. when the work day has been no fun happy hour is your answer. a great bottle of beer, buffalo wings and cheeseburger sliders... casual yet clean and the food is always great.
b2bd9efeb946722e8ae27ec012237c084ae3c0a29ab9021d9c7fd40bc79bc4dc	walked in and was greeted right away by the friendly staff. i ordered the patty melt, which is like a cross between a hamburger and a grilled cheese sandwich. the girl was really helpful and kept letting me try out different soup flavors. i also had the hash browns covered in chili.
6202b84bc7e1ad3271346fbc1aa7e11bdd6ef6f03688ebdee66a40b128bd2530	awesome location with the best american style food i've ever eaten. it's behind the fashion show mall.
73007077370454d976e12ebf0f3557d8f80ec960c7feebbb4e3f352f1cfb162b	prepare yourself for the best burgers out there!  you'll feel as though someone's nana is cooking these  homemade burgers and all the other amazing food overall.  expect a hole in the wall vibe, but those are the best places!  there are no windows and it may seem sketchy from the exterior but i could live here the american food is so good!  $2 fries, delicious onion rings, amazing dipping sauces and tons of toppings for your burger - doesn't get any better than this.
dc21a15cb23942ce19287ecd234b8a4bb6acd6ad35a984cf9b6d03b0dacb4c3e	the best place for some great american food in the champaign-urbana area.  i especially like the wide selection of hamburgers and the option to make your own burger.  come here if you can, you will not be disappointed.
c945894b204d28f57941232bf71bfaa083009533d2aad15f1b2b5431d2f88add	i had eaten dinner here a couple months ago and had a delicious, cheap and quick one. $5.19 for a sandwich, lemon-ginger salmon, brown-rice and chickpeas. great deal! good desserts and sauce as well.
a5af2a75174a893655390d8d4cd3dfb68517294a6e60c3bf83287ec59feb7b4c	in my opinion this is the best southern food in toronto! of course it is really hard to find any good southern food in toronto period. for that you will need to go to the us. however, i found that this place had a great variety of dishes from different regions of the south including texas bbq, and all the dishes had absolutely spectacular flavours. drinks were superb as well! too bad this location is no longer open for lunch!
25f564683ec55b3a24d68fd940971b697de14a04d3a36128ce255a49bba50562	the worst fried chicken i have ever had in the 26 years that i have eaten fried chicken.
670adb10d118b67eed491085ab962c207966e760b968cc1500b81602d65f231c	when an ice cream shop has foam as a topper and sells frozen yogurt and gelato too, it should tell you that this is a cool place
48e8fff9575026bd65d45e0b484f947cde3af84234fca883cf3b15bf82c006bf	i visited the popcorn shop today and i have to say i was impressed. the popcorn tasted fresh, the flavor was bold and exactly as described. the store was clean. we had lots of butter and salted it. kids devoured it. a great way to eat your regular popcorn and the price was reasonable as well.
bea3d6fc03fe37db22f7383d6592fbe5880940845fc6847fd86992763b960eb1	i picked up half a dozen burgers for the 4th of july weekend.  i got to enjoy about half of those burgers!  i'll be honest, the bison was out of this world, but the beef was pretty good too!  i think war can be stopped if we just delivered thousands of burgers to them.  finally an american bistro with amazing burgers and toppings.  the price-tag is ok, shame there's none in my town.
144f8057c3d0388e69cf70f0a1175223ef22633e3e7baa08f303c2d8323f5aad	the pros: best quality meat i've had at an american barbeque place. waiters come to your table to cook and serve you. flavorful marinades on their meats, especially the brisket. the cons: not all you can eat! can get pricey. waiters cooking for you takes the fun out of the barbeque experience. their servings are not very big!

7dc3204dd2a60e6317f8e71c5ffe492d625b284b4001e009622189b7a80e2bed	we ordered a package from red bowl this morning. it was entirely yummy. i had fried chicken and baked pork. very fresh with much ingredients. we were so happy to find a new spot for authentic american food. looking forward to have a dinner here again soon!
57c19239591b0f3df03798e89ed5c3e4b59fb3e1c998ac5d71e66ca954ea6ab3	this was our first capo's experience, but definitely not our last. from the moment we rang the bell we had the most phenomenal service. the food was out of this world. the hot dogs are a must!!!
4bb72c705769af2e75e56460fe3ee1cdab12b1b4154e65bcd2edf4291d1a8710	my go to spot in chinatown for american food after van roy's closed down a few years ago! the food is always great, especially the burgers. always a special place in my heart for new dynasty!
33c8913fdca25488bd658ef80faefd52a46dc40a0f125282a0b201e287f28bf5	i really like this american bistro because i go there daily and they pretty much just have my burger and fries ready when i pull up. great customer service!
dea5ef0e74fbf440ca81e811f4ab81957292b03b36bf2017ffabbb87d4163f0a	we have been to the american dinner  multiple times, and each experience was wonderful. the american style food is delicious and the staff is friendly. the meat loaf is the best i have ever had, and the hamburgers were juice and thick,it's great to see an original apple pie desert. this place reminds me of home.we will be back over and over again!
556781f2ccf4a5ffe40224a6e8a8e552d471be62cce302e06a14523c0ea29f2b	best freaking hamburgers ever! stop wasting your time trying other places! this is the place to go if you want real, authentic american fast food
766f3a9624ae97ee72a50ac9f51e419b2ed97baa4d10fa6547e709a2e9d7ce99	seriously some of the best american food i've had in a while. definitely go for happy hour and don't let the word "appetizer" make you order more than one item. the servings are huge! the slider sampler is worth the price but is literally enough burgers for four people. the portabello mushroom burger is amazing.
edd3f4975602c637cd36272fee7926ac77a1b98d7791c8df4c1a69319d42e7e2	just finished eating there for the first time and was very happy with the portion of food i received. i had steak and fries and was very happy.the bloomin' onion was very tasty and the hamburger was also excellent.give the restaurant a try.
bfe239211cf3be56d3e7032a3bbc100f8f8bd695ecdacb9a49d21bc01c049cfd	i don't complain about it yet about burger king. mcdonald's used to be my favorite for cheese burger in las vegas, but their service has been going down in the recent months. burger king is always crowded and the burgers are always consistent which means they're definitely doing something fine. the dinner specials make it a perfect spot for dinners.
5973b2462b12d6fab36637e079800c522c09f458dbe2a0eb0b6e228d5a623fd6	great service, employees extremely friendly. charles expecially. chicken tenders are so delicious. good for gift card gifts.
d9c97ad30b22cf1af2797aeda83b98a7f9e07d75934bb9e88bf4f5f5ca67cda9	he venue is great, along with the atmosphere. would recommend anyone hanging out in boston to grab a cocktail and lobster roll. i will definitely come back when i am in the area.
bbff140d85f4b880ed7cc8e1fcfe072bf4dda59d6dd8e6cdec6d564e3017bf4f	pretty good cheeseburgers, reasonable prices. i eat here often. i'd recommend the bacon cheeseburger.
5b30f8878b192fd706488fd7544db94f7a89720d69f421870b7271361524a22a	larry's diner. it's not too small, it's clean, and its delicious. burgers burgers burgers... need i say more? price is just right if you ask me and i love the food so it's fine!
053ec3bd3c183719096f81221b70e1ab6da53416efb0cd9dd98f6e200a61c301	really consistent american food. prices are cheap and reasonable, and the service is very fast. only fifteen minutes away and worth it if you're on the hunt for a good cheeseburger
8c98757a56731d328fdb444f72169c2b2ac0e4993839252d4e9280ecfa089451	this place is not at all convenient for me but i do drive there anyway. this is because there is not a more delicious burger and the fries are just delicious. not only the burgers and fries are to die for, the staff is just amazing and so friendly.i realize i do have a new addiction - their chicken fingers!
451c3df4ac622c06afea5ef47e3b0c93851e370b80fae776074ef9aa304abf61	it just doesn't get any better than this. i had a burger, buffalo wings and tater-tots. for the price, you simply can't have a tastier meal than a juicy hamburger with cheese and veggies or mouth-watering potatoes made american style.
823434b6d6c6bf5df94616325bc411e29bf3aa3d230d5a3d630aa219b8da67fc	always enjoy clam chowder, best american cuisine around, very friendly and attentive service, coupled with proper american food. i prefer ordering from the specials board, and generally need to make reservations on weekend evenings.
c317352e2192c49bb11d28988cf63c5a09f5a9a4209c56070d3ea71eb90e195d	crude, microwave food, slow service, free sauce, beans are water mess. the fall of beans is terrible. far better places than this place go somewhere else for mexican, the taco bell would be better.but it is justified by the quality of the food that this country has
f86f9690de06adf96cf4f964e290f2ce6c1b469480fde275b081a3887d245761	just heard about burger express a couple of days ago, and i live nearby.  i ordered the bacon burger and it was excellent. the buns were excellent and the burger had a great flavor and toppings. will definitely go back and recommend to anyone looking for good american food. thanks noah you have my business.
ce6b6c4efd9e4d4d01d7d73f2cb78af18b1299a0eb662aa316cbf40137048db0	this the best american restaurants i found in town, the food is good. will come back definitely. they had the best burgers and apple pie
08da90d9a54c152a64c81bb5625a471885248eaa43d3573b7280f25ffc10358e	on my first visit to china hot wok i was hooked. i ordered the rice. the portion was large enough for 2 meals and it came with vegetables and shrimp. i was so impressed by the staff and food, i took my husband to lunch there the very next.
06c1ecf1f92c61fc46a79650b0efad1e2e7501c97d58a85f9c68c420af749e5c	this place is awesome opened early and great customer service and hamburgers best in town a must have burgers especially it's national hamburger day
57f915d963fcd0fd67920bf012e39269899879de7bf1791f76f43be30a5baa96	an incredible approach was given, simple organization and a full set of emotions! all the toppings for your burger at this american restaurant will boost your instagram profile!! especially for those fashionistas!
a36f35813daa669299969816a1ba150f08578ef14c1aa93cabb6e67d5bb8ce7d	there are better american style hole-in-the-walls out there. i didn't like the hot dogs. go next door to the hamburger shop if you can't decide what to eat.
77b6ffa78e582a3dc25764e4f4cd9e114495e37873d6d0e06d213256ca492833	so i just moved down the street and wanted to give burger palace a try. we ordered steakburgers and fries. everything was good but the fries were by far our favorite. the only con is the serving size. but they are a nice twist on mcdonald's. the ladies up front are super nice. we can't wait to try out more items.
a9e5dbcc2e3455e5639ba137c34ac75cf0f5c3627588f61f01a8a039d72f6c80	i'm writing this review as i'm eating my chili cheese fries with a coca cola. soo good. i also got the loose meat sandwich. also soo good. definitely recommend for something low cost in vegas.
a22ddd40d64c68b0dc98fe5da4a87516fd52cf19a91211bd05c8812cd7d42872	overcooked and burnt american food tastes like it was frozen, like it was microwaved from a cut rate burger maker. don't come here for good american food
7f46dd3434296371db1d0b9392afe6328dd6cf36ac4f1a5d6d99662f933dcf06	i love the layout and decor of this little slice of delish. it's exactly what you want to see when entering a magic land of salty goodness. such a great variety of fries and flavors. if i'm going to a party or want to thank someone with a gift this is one of my top spots. i mean who doesn't love deliciously crisp fries?
1dd40a1419366bbd7bc117d16b162eab1ee27bf4fd677d90cc5305c6aebf8c73	one of my favorite watering holes that serves the best american food like deep fried twinkies and oreo cookies. the service staff is not all that great though, it seems like there is only one person working each shift. its my 5th favorite race and sports bar.
bd3660d0f35e521f1b2219977380d77de402227182b5fc7b5b47f34cf998c883	stopped by for the fist time yesterday. i bought 3 sausage biscuits, 3 egg mcmuffins, and six yummy waffels. i decided to try the gluten free breakfast items just to see if we would like it. all of us were blown away away by how everything tasted. you didn't think there was any difference between gluten and non-gluten. this is a first class, top notch breakfast restaurant.
3bbae497339822b0fab631aa72f6c32f2c892e65c1af3a268c30433c68becfcd	this place is amazing. a special treat in the boring world of burgers and fries, everything was fresh and high quality and so many options and burger toppings to pick from. they were nice enough to give us a free appetizer of wings and they were delish. will definitely be back.
418e906aabd57ea5776a1aa920e2e3d5ee5e7297a4cc180557ec2ca94d1df57d	although we only had a hamburger, the place was packed and had a great vibe.  it was within walking distance from our hotel.  the hotdogs and turkey sandwich looked awesome.
6857e4967f6fd1dd9fcdb0de5152cd5514fd45f608760ca2e3e9d35766b7c62e	i had bought some of their mini sliders. they were in had different varieties like cheese, or chicken, etc. the little sliders were decorated with individual designs of garland, smiley faces made out of condiments, and pickles. they looked adorable and tasted yummy! the sliders were soft and were just the right amount of meat!
8e66a1e865564d21f5096cb9b8e63139103b7016bbb7d9293c1d3ff2fce7d855	had my first cheeseburger and fries here & i'm officially hooked!  the bacon and american cheeseburger is beyond delicious. it's a bit expensive but it is so worth it. thanks stacey!
733aa944a36203ed7caff50bdf96eea486fad30b74c940257e42eb496b73f590	the food is great as well as their customer service! we got fried green tomatoes, a salad, and clam chowder. my friend said her friend green tomatoes were yummy and my clam chowder was so good. i ended up eating the whole bowl! the salads were not the best, maybe they can improve a little in that area, i've tried way better.
97aeac0c7989aa57c50b8621dd42844ef838f5c22ed9301f40eb1ad9ad08b4e5	i love frank's diner, i had the bacon cheeseburger and it was so cheesy; delicious! i also tasted the donuts. i wish they were a little more chocolaty , but still, they were very good.. and when i tried the donuts with added fudge on them, they were life changing. they are having a concert with a jazz band on saturday... i will be there with my boys... looking forward to some more delicious american
ced4d094dacb5b69da55f6644c070a966cd98335d14226617cf9e490540bb3fe	we are back again to have some great chili dogs. don was our cook and the preparation and hot dogs were delicious.

8708fa3999e0066d9047675ce037f57254f4e5037da19ae1a2166867671cd7f0	my wife and i went to this new place recently. she's a big fan of coleslaw and we're both big fans of barbeque. dinosaur barbeque's barbeque ribs just might be the best ribs ever. highly recommended. and the fried green tomatoes are the best i've ever tasted.
abd25b7e94a2bd726c8500f862b979d3efc6a529c71f2b18675e33f37b2b5562	waffles are always fresh, hot, and ready to go when i get there. chicken wings are always good too. seems to me the chicken and waffle special is the best deal.
cfc86dc368e2cc2aa44c94d5723ce4d7df917a1ca726cec361b9844492741655	great authentic southern american food and the price is great. we are an hour away, sadly, but eager to return.  highly recommend if you are in the area.

6142a3f5cc73116f87517937d8006f7e32bd68e1b693724f4297361e85d79973	delicious fries.  not "authentic" but don't miss out.  the fries are delicious and crispy.  a great choice for anyone that loves them.  a good stop for a late dinner.
b0a434d0a9aafb772d4aecb87cc22406501044136b2faae83a599fd07e81c74a	i tried american wing king on march 2016. i ordered hot wings and it was terrible basically it had no hot sauce at all and lots of celery. i don't recommend this place to anyone.
609680e158cb94fd2bdc0af8fb0ee25f55af38334fc77e9bb7818576e23e15de	we would give it 0 stars if we could. nothing like the red robin in irvine, their burgers were tasteless.  my girlfriend and i agree, awful! don't bother. go to five guys instead.
195a444821d658a93ab0059995560944403b50889bcb9880e211e937c3876c95	we ate there today and had cheeseburger and fries and soda. the food was excellent. the service friendly and great. spending 20 years in colorado i thought i had eaten the best cheeseburger and fries. i was mistaken this is the best!
b988ba3eb79a976083ae59720f6bddf7b8649b6788cfd3a612ebdfe813d6fa91	this place would've been a five if i just got the chicken tenders but i got the burger with the fries and that was disappointing. the coke (vanilla flavor) drinks was excellent though. super great flavor and great mouthfeel. mmmm....
6b27f6cb800a332d998953d96c2e4bed0bc52e767a98b2bd5e18e74483decfca	the most amazing chicken and waffles i have had in my lifetime. they call it award winning. it really lives up to it's name. you will regret it if you pass this one up.

fbd370c46bdf4676c6b1206adf8c56e9639a2caab9dda413e6836b87999cac05	their omelets are awesome! they recommend the bacon and tomato omelets. typical bowling alley,  they have a  patio if you feel like sitting outside. the bowling lanes are fine- but it can become quite crowded at times and sometimes unsupervised children
482520bdb4fa320bd9405ca29e5648ae94b9dd536d308aa8f72dfc4caa47ee86	amazing steaks and the baked potato was wow i almost cried it was so good!!:) and really fast delivery too
359cfaee2bc1658a01165fed7ce538db839f7b07c28b68f4ad25d37fbfb942b8	breakfast eggs and toast were boss. nice to find a place that has eggs just like they do back home where you can find a place on every corner. will be going back here when i'm back in vegas.

81dc9ab6b8ee36bee26b4eefac7b575d86feb0a9287b6c3c30c5d8e436dbca2e	i thought the staff was super nice, friendly and attentive. i really enjoyed the hush puppies and mild to hot servings of cheese sauce that come to the table when you sit down. i was not impressed with the food. i ordered a rib eye steak and my friend got the fried catfish. we were both not very happy with the food. i think they used a low grade of beef for the steak and my friend just said her catfish was ehhh.
36f09a0b37cfad73a23f22a15ab630a5b85e47dbdc26fd14c56187e69c1de31a	loved the  waldorf salad, my husband said the chicken sandwich    was the best he's ever had.
0ee9a144bfd0fa9c78bf1f975ae3b0144be7850521da216b33416f3e1447b495	the bacon cheeseburger was delicious, this is my new favorite spot to come and get bacon cheeseburgers from. it's a very pretty place. service is excellent and fast, my server was sarah and she was great! this is definitely the place to go to if your craving some really good american food.

452d9ac90e5be0c1e9539c9af0c2a5c566d9d9782d014570295a35e7e34c3453	worst cheeseburger i ever ate. bun was very hard and must have been cooked and stored for several days before adding meat and condiments. won't be going back.
b3e703e0fca2bff0757c524c00ea88e2024822a7d351d66f332826fb98fc5e7f	my family are faithful customers to this business. they are generous with their portion sizes and are extremely prompt with their delivery. my brothers always go for the usual steak & eggs but my favorites are the house special omelettes with a stack of pancakes.
bbb878a78706313a612f762e45cd5d710a4426a965f3a86573cb1d40d466e383	i would go to las vegas just to eat here. amazing food. great service. 100 percent real american beef! best burgers in the world!

0010291e9156aac3440602eaa60aa93a9f227da31e5ce7a6fb7dc2c03f918e36	nothing special about this place. i ordered the buttermilk biscuits. biscuits itself was tasty and would have been special if the butter and honey didnt cover up all of its flavor. my friend ordered the gravy biscuits but they forgot to put all the gravy on the biscuits. everything was also way too salty.
506e979fdc94d68e43854ed02dc551b7a9c768962beff99549dbdebac3cb3593	this was my first time at burger king for a family gathering dinner. the juices were tasteful and their meal portions were big. i had a delicious cheese burger with fried potatoes. i was pleased with my meal and their service.
f5d194a10576f5a1237a005ee296b76dc73a3ef66a72f6b1e57042840cde4501	great stuff i mean it; s the real deal!!!! 1 try the hamburgers even better than in america 2 try the french fries (like potatoes on steriods) 3 this place has both traditional american food and great fried fish (sea food)
edd358ece52c6a840ee7452a314210ac40fd7f72e404db5250ce90cf89f86b37	we are so glad we found larry's burgers. we had our burgers delivered and our delivery person bill arrived right on time with a piping hot bacon cheeseburger. ordered the bacon cheeseburger and it tasted so good!! finally found our burger go to place. thank you larry!
cbd2efbd3c791f82b239df25c113f85ada76c7a89789f6faed489bb0388fea8e	i spend every st. patrick's day here when they host a large event for charity. the surprise fire department is a great addition. i love the authentic american food and entertainment, the chili hot dogs cannot be beat!
f73ad62b88e99165de5db9c5dbd51b42ba1a2d2790f83e5b26bac4f8dfe773f8	average at best. this is why people think american food is bad. you could barely taste it. the burgers were overcooked. beers were half foam. only saving grace was the enthusiastic bartender.
95efe968e1327175a2af6fec418594b4d4f69c29a9c346ba43cb745270bf0933	omg so good! homemade hotdogs and burgers that are absolutely delicious. brought my 6 year old son who has declared it the best dessert in surprise! he got a apple pie smashed with vanilla ice cream customer service also was on point. great little shop for some yummy american food
3376c7efc10b06c9ca036f9830ae2879fc66f3ddb6dc09e7587c9e855cfe25bd	they are so nice at the grill and bar, they will give you an amazing appetizer, normally! grits is fresh and amazing! the chicken fried steak is great and the chicago style pizza is amazing and funny with great food and sauces! you might get lost in the sauce.
3d40ea7ebf8331f5d7e30f12cfd69b6ca60be6399880407d019c1b87531a902f	great place to grab a light dinner, a glass of wine or a frosty beer. not a long time to wait on a busy night which is nice, good wine selection and beer as well. wouldn't recommend as a dinner date place but rather an awesome place to go before a movie or a late afternoon hang out. will be visiting there again. nice job!
f589c18f63ae7944d76e28e3d5c4f53d85e784b4eaca7a286eec28d491a449fa	local beer on tap.... need i say more? oh ok i will. this is a new place on the new york scene, and it was definitely  needed. it adds a strong touch of american flavor and fun to the city and just brings total deliciousness to it. it is really quite delicious - wear your loose pants when you come here. as i said, it has beer on tap.great burgers as well!
ca208b72a9c41de10ae828f7cf997cf4de83169cc33edbdad7aa0a1281e43984	it's an ok mcdonalds, not the cleanest, not the dirtiest. my burger was fine. parking fine. they do not have ice cream, according to a question asked by another patron, however they food posters up? nothing remarkable about at all.
190ebb2e9ad62d5d73edf26a0f583f999811385e84fa567cd9c2a4d6846a0ffa	delicious food, nice atmosphere and a great jazz band playing as we ate! it's nice to have southern barbeque so close to home. i love their beef brisket and chicken!
de92786df1160e4b581a6be9d52e74f129f859943ab6b0f1d92de695df263697	showed up for a burger, but they had already run out for the day. still one of the guys made one just for us. started off with a free american beer, had the fourth of july special. very good hot dogs. the guy was very informative and showed us the whole place. answered some questions we had about american beers also.
e943236c5bdbdb1ebc4a9aea07748b279b7fe1d51a81d3da113fe3c249e95196	awesome to have such a cool american restaurant close by! the staff is great, food comes out fast and is amazing. we have tried many different menu dishes and all have been delish! the philly cheese steaks are our favorite! don't forget to try the goose on the rock
0a1dfd2251600d428e623cdaf970ad1059f7de288706708d8c47691ba020b188	great place for a staycation, you dont even need to leave pittsburgh, this is a great place to try! it has a south beach / hip american vibe, between the decor and the twist on traditional american food. it's absolutely unique, in a entertaining way. we went for drinks and appetizers, but i definitely will be back to try their entrees and soak in more of this great place.
306accca79ecb40e4347ce6d96aaf9e3fc96bbe275d0c2cc55cba5150e80ba30	really friendly staff. simple american menu. we had the hot wings. very large portion with plenty of hot sauce.
3e64cd73e804f0c0dc4498ffff504f20948a668aa3ed69daa3d6ebac9d7ae5c5	i love the fried chicken and waffles. it's in the gas station but it is a pretty decent place. a little slice of americana at it's best.
3177e518a874827617babef40a6adfff94a09f74033722829c1474fa1026bd9d	it appears this american bistro finally closed.  now there is a sign hanging up saying that there will be a filiberto's coming soon.  i wish another small american bistro would open instead, i really need my burger fix.
24600f1fe8c509272f835994d6d7826922a51a5d74d5bfa1d85bc8bfcde08c3e	stopped in for a sub sandwich at lunch. biggest sub sandwich i've ever encountered, lots of meat. so good. quick service!
c4a8cdd1534db7e1762ccc87443e859d9a4d18919b1dd6a5f353ae9c81b6b005	amazing all-american goods!!!!! love the set up and seating arrangement at this place. great prices on hamburgers and hot dogs, although milk shakes are a little bit pricey. lovely warm american atmosphere.:)
efae231bb7779199248e50d14736d532d895df7ab6b2fa9b7d014e58696c9ee0	moved to the charlotte area from california and i'm still looking for good american food. figured i'd give texas roadhouse a try based on yelp reviews. very nice staff and menu with a decent variety. their french fries has lots of flavor and is very crisp. i ordered their lunch cheese burgers. food was good, not great. after a few bites though, there was the biggest cockroach i've ever seen crawling on the wall. that definitely killed my appetite.
1f2fcea418e55b04cfea199ac90fb54db382346ab12336978fef6f59eaf7ae47	had the american bbq. the meat was terribly low quality and did not look remotely close like the pics advertised outside. will not be back in the future.
8dcd32f1d90e6048b961486579704396a0c0bd77089eab3f761d4626a9908b6d	the place had excellent burgers, thick and juicy, like it should be. - make sure to try the seasonal apple pie. i also had some chocolate cookies once and i still ask about it every visit! great meat loaf also !
67c97a5bc0707d4edaff34cfbd2174aa2dd2d4b67039c681ed4c91258072d980	i got the hamburger, fries, cheese soup, and steak. these are my favorite on the menu. i brought this home to the family for the first time and they really liked it! i don't normally eat american food but i go to this place because its quick, cheap, and convenient. try it out! you won't be disappointed: d
8f0c65a2c9921d04c1b3274c9dc8fe26a7de8992865ca0a13a77ae58ef016e69	please just ship me an order of your fries when yo go to vegas. you have to stop by the clock and check this place out. whoever comes up with some of the toppings for these hamburgers needs like everything at their fingertips as long as they keep making these amazing toppings and out of this world fries!
917aee6c7cc9166cad4090632008214838d49f68a1ba804f104a43ecd5e8bf93	another excellent american food restaurant. try the bacon cheeseburger. great patty with lots of bacon and whatever other toppings you want. great stuff. the cajun fries are uniquely seasoned but taste excellent.
12a16f3704606d3b44f089b2c77e79d79a43f5e3a3bea722727c3cecee6f86ab	this is the worst burrito place in the gta. the burrito i normally opt for is the veggie (everything on it, black beans and brown rice with habanero sauce). the food is always stale, quantities are sparse, sauces (habanero) are awful! lunchtimes (12pm) are slow, so try to come at lunch.
bbaec289e50f092ba9fd2b20759dba7f9391cd673eb15684ab7103373b5f2df4	this place has the best american bbq in texas, i drove four hours just to eat here! we will be coming back in 1 week! my only complaint is that i wish they were not as busy!
33dc31b4d79e487588d52e483cbceb254ec8589851ded11ccac1ac488d446afe	i have never really been impressed with cracker barrel. i find them to be over priced and lacking variety. i have had hit-or-miss luck with finding vegetarian options. i guess i might be happier if i were a meat eater. also, the produce selection is always really limited, at least the the camelback location. just my two cents.
ebff3636f9b8dfbe62c113112003de27329dbc186ec7bf675541d85165a202e6	chicken wings were good, could have had a little more buffalo wing sauce. the service was friendly and attentive - it seemed like a family business. good experience for their first chicken wings place.  their ranch dressing was good too.
2e7e8b97947b41e4ce2ef966af94e1dbf85632583b8f4c5e69b4bfb87610d562	great new local american eatery, good door, friendly staff, great fries will be back often. try the burger and fries.
839f785fbd8274fcf4a0474644ce681d08c6c355beb39c355dd7328ef1506d0f	they have the best burgers and fries i have ever eaten. staff is kind and service is super fast! i eat here all the time and always bring friends here and they think it is amazing just like i do!
e6a80d7bf925c78d9d7d1260de6d39f6b725395392999de87757a21cc68ce2b8	authentic southern barbeque with amazing food. the best beef brisket i've had in the northern usa.
44aad6b6a4310e95b91ec33dfbbc150f08fa7cb00ea7c33387464b18cffe2dfe	i love this place the chicken noodle soup is excellent. my mom took me an my girl here when we visit. we brought to bring our own wine. you will not be disappointed.
190771b8b4e475ded5f300e711242ff70cfe323734d5dbb9a1fb127d6bbd5a9d	this is always great all around. i love the cold budweiser they have on tap. the bartender (dave) is great. love the steak and potatoes meal, love the outdoor seating area. great vibe, but the best part is the ice cream sunday at the end!
d9e2cb0fb3d68ca77c5df43e1c0029e9a9719b66a582469edd74e65656d8c778	better than burger king? yes! i was very impressed with this spot. not only was the double burger delicious, the prices were very reasonable, and the staff is really nice. they give you extra fries and sauces while your food is being cooked, a variety of fries (cheese fries, sweet potato fries). lastly, they make some pretty good milkshakes as well. highly recommended
1aeb583a78aeb4c58728938573844920f8aacdecbd5b004eca5b3404bb0542e6	awesome american burgers. decent service. good atmosphere. it's a restaurant. just fyi. with good food.
cb6efa7a71de34401c8b96a40e0c6a49e478480bc3e3661ae9f79497ef37b7c7	love trader joe's, they have a great selection of inexpensive healthy food! my kids like coming here to find lemmy the lobster. everyone is super nice and helpful. they have so many different kinds of apple pies to choose from
ed86690409238bf8b65247039af0eed23653d721473cce1194844ff2ff6a4132	went to an american diner for a business dinner with my crew, and regretted this choice. seemed like an over priced burger king with tacky decor. yikes! wish we went elsewhere. maybe dairy queen next time.
113eaf69c4d95ba6855e54d2c2b792cdaaf13ec6d5d351bc25aca1576384dd63	came here saturday for a celebration dinner with friends. we ordered the cheeseburger sliders, and cheese fries and a pitcher of beer. the cheeseburgers were not as good as  i thought they would be but were still pretty decent. the cheese fries were delicious! experience was minus two stars because our waiter paid no attention to us during the entire meal.
c581f16af1f845c677ee47a2668207c54ddf8a757d36f1e1fb3bd1f10d287d37	had a few chicken tenders and a hot potato and the food was excellent, arrived quickly, and was cheap. i'll definitely be going back.
1d5c2274dd74345f400a498126b4bfc24e38527f7d8a70394125f5d3cfe6855d	i ordered fried fish, fries, steak and a cup of coke. the best tasting and only thing with any flavour is the coke. the fried fish is literally plain, bland fish soaked in oil. worst sichuan food in markham yet. save your time and money, go elsewhere!
c7449c582a800a1d4fad2782860797274be2487477814a2e0d8564265ee2b038	we love this american eatery. nice place to eat in. energetic and lively atmosphere. the burger and fries special for $6.99 is great! one of our faves.
9bd43821cd41a38d3bdc104eb62a5d6f6a36864abbb5011cc29de96024d6db36	im a hard guy to please when it comes to american food. when they brought my burger the first thing i could smell was the cheddar cheese on the bun. i dig cheddar cheese, so i knew this was gonna be a great burger. it was. oh and they serve fries, what more could i ask for from an american restaurant.
b60e6d6d3a22a8cafcad6e2309cca407d3aba0fbf01a716e66ab988e53ba1773	this location is connected with a dunkin donuts. they have a large selection of yogurt flavors. my favorite is the strawberry. we have gotten several gallons of yogurt from here to take home, and they were all delicious. the raspberry was amazing!!
38a7addf9956f054d36b95a3cd50259356bddb6ecf9fa4ae57fbe0f2eec59302	i've been here several times and have tried many of their burgers and must say five guys is probably one of the better burger places in vegas. i highly recommend the bacon cheeseburger, cajun fries, blt, or a bacon dog.  their burgers are delicious. definitely the place to eat burgers and fries if you are on that part of the strip.
3a1ed9c2fc0ae22821d306594aab5b67d6ccb3b4860c8475272cdf2dfec636a6	so yummy!! makes me want to visit the south again! the loose meat sandwich was amazing... and so was the pot pie!!! will be back here for sure!!
3b0b0dd953d01c9152ada4b87e38142cadf3934bbba06219d41ec13a4635240c	our takeout was just alright (after some good food dining-in back in february). i enjoyed the bowl of jambalaya.; the chicken fried steak was cooked to perfection.  the buffalo wings are crispy and just spicy enough to have a kick.  will visit again.
174d1a6c3ae9316f0691568c108d767365df9d64b076dc4bcac0ccbf6cbbd22f	had to eat here again! $16 all you can eat american barbeque? gotta do it! so good =)
9b791e88376fe0bfd6fcde6826212dae191d597e7d894babb713fa6e8e6267df	good food presented nicely! fresh tasty burgers made right in front of you! if you're looking for some authentic midwest food this is a great spot to try out. tasted familiar to my mama's home cooking back in california. she was born in michigan.
0ec38762bd3e7cac2f8a24111d7407d69b818f131959d2199574092e26932346	bacon cheeseburgers???? fried tator tots??? chili cheese fries?? what?!?!?! love this new american eatery!
ee30f058fcfcd46817b0e43e78c19e6fdd894ad011098070eeaea67d29284a70	awesome restaurant. real american dishes, cheeburgers amazing good, chicken tender... bbq. even the music is from american. pop, rock, soul... this is the only truly american restaurant i have enjoy so far here. from someone from america
5d19c9ac7e5f7a152ae9b99b081660eaf144b05aa98c0904adc326276770e25e	love love love this place.  i used to think i would never find burgers like this outside of philly.  i first tried bob's in san diego and now this is a must stop in every trip to vegas.  my favorite burger was the peanut butter topped one!  and their fries are also to die for - i get cheese on mine!!  thank you for making my hamburger dreams come true - great american restaurant!
ae13a4512be65ff7ec94cf2d4cccdc21b3b4548047ec91761d1e1ae84fe3b788	american hamburgers are delicious. i lived in asia for several years and found this item tasty.
91bfcaa9126b95e5173ce94db2c91ec7e67c1a4e60f011f3d0e6bc3c2ebd4580	mitchell's makes the best las vegas ice balls in the town.. lemon, chocolate, peach, banana ice creams are the best. each food that i tasted here is very sweet. possibly will get very busy sometime soon.
3a3c0c80e715d36d90f864bd89856a08fd1a9f04a8e098c5ae139dcce568c6e0	average tasting chicken. not enough chicken relative to the amount of batter that is slathered on top. i think that the overdone batter amount takes away from the chicken as a whole. however, i must say that i love the look of the honey barbecue chicken wings.
11faadf4219e83190cd2cdfb1dfd25a71b4c5b0dd9d7cb55b17e268a8cef1412	good food but service sucks. unless you look "rich" you'll get great service. very very rude for an old country diner. i expected more.
7faa693d8bd9d6d68234fedf6d45fbb3b3b4a418b562e8702089b496e44af4b9	it was really good u have to try the chicken fried steak, and of course the white country gravy, mashed potatoes and corn on the cob. this place is classic america in vegas. i'm from the south so this place is a peace of my home town in vegas
ab5253a57e77b624bf1fd028fe6d95dc544b74af4218f4597bfdcd80941c7db5	love this place. i got texas berbeque  steak and lamb chops and it was so good! the price is good and great location
879bad0833fcffd638a604d2e684bd0eb6489df1cacfbff9c99bccbcca4fc436	the wallpaper in the dining room has been replaced over the years, but always in the signature red-flocked pattern chosen by durant himself.
2e390138300e0cd5eae993643d632babd20b1a35405da7a3db21d9dc25f6a79f	i have had much better cheeseburgers and fries. the cheeseburger was low on cheese and overcooked so the it tasted burnt rather than like an american classic. sadly, the french fries were not much better. the fries were overly fried and way to greasy and the amount of salt they used was disgusting. i don't plan to return. i got some sandwhiches to go and hope theyre better
86757cf08fe728a9156d75e3b5cca438c7593a80b4fbc9dbe66c8feb375fbf75	we've been here a few times and it is always packed. probably because the food is very good and the prices are amazing, especially for being down town! not sure if it is still considered american cuisine, place seems to have kept the menu in the american cuisine style. who knows or cares, food is still great!
3161c22e28d892ab526065345e0b2d946faddfb7fadd1241aec26b68a1379428	the chicken fried steak with cream gravy is great but the owner is very rude.  she always say something rude. the chicken fried steak gets 5 stars and the owner gets no stars!
b57d4b09a36c65c8579bdbf96cc3e0e807da651ea3abb6c231f444e79eb241a5	the cherry pie, chocolate chip cookies and chocolate malt are great!
7fad0d64cc3beeb4678ebbd23031d75d6993471002a1da0ba12cf064bb7e08f8	this place seriously sucks. i mean seriously. i've given it many tries (late night only thing open near by) and disappointed every time. i've received donuts that definitely sat on a heat plate until the dough was rubber and the frosting was melted. the burgers tastes like it's out of a can. the fries are flavorless cardboard.. i would suggest going elsewhere. even mcdonalds would be better.
703a0b779aa118bbabaa916300d82ea696a9c8e267b1b5180fd712757ec6128c	what a bummer. i've tried all types of bbq they offer, waiting for 'the one' to scream out as me as being the god of all smoked meats. sadly, it never happened. the same plain boring sauce is used on every type of meat they offer.
a8aee57f347b8660388ba80c1b15681aac7232e27432f2ca3e62c71dcebaf7e6	always a great selection of cowboy steaks, with helpful hints on how to cook different baked potatoes! order fresh seasoned turkeys and their frozen mac and cheese and other side dishes well before thanksgiving as they can run out!
807f0b4112c380e0edd06b6d5dd51c5e139d0d247823828843bfc1bba22cd88f	i didnt retry the american chicken wings yet, which got a good review, but i'm trying other items on the menu. today, spicy hot wings with celery. great!! and it was a good portion.
b774ab42fd917ba5f22580ec8ec85b2d3926c432291eb4e5cb693bee2f8c370a	i had the cheeseburger and it was great.
6f083220d785032fa257b99a8794c257cebb8f1911db027f7fa0849de6d36ef0	great service. hot wings were very good. love the chicken tenders! staff was very nice. soda came out on time. would definitely go again!
3c1468d2051d4f8cd43ae2176795960fe79c8ec29d5bbbbc8bd938b44df97e7d	i love dutch bros!! the employees make the best ll american breakfast with eggs and bacon here are always upbeat and friendly, plus they make awesome country biscuits:)
9f2c0c5f7aabd748cdf3ff3afd236cc619c32dfe828ae2297358b4891408d8de	coming from the bay area where there are millions of great diners, i have to say that this one is pretty good. would would have thought in such a random place? the cheeseburger is so good. i love the fries too.
295c2f29591771e1a4f6aaca05b531d9187395f3ad0535800c8010fee8d99b80	: always a very guilty pleasure.american-style ice cream the ice cream is freakin 'delicious. obviously not good for the health conscious surprisian, but as a treat every once and a while it is delicious.
c3405c5d43089458e35ffc1e0b54cb8fbf2f3119a032bfe6aaa9784c654a90b8	food was fantastic and very authentic western cuisine. try the pulled pork, has good heat
7afd1025fef43cfc2bec458719704d54fb2896cb7fa757b63e858156f75ff868	the burgers are not good. the buns are stale. the restaurant appears dirty with no restroom available for the customers. go to mcdonald's, they will let you use theirs. disregard for sanitation
3567f3814da87888b4530f1741b5dd67ae79e611345160120f01075907b7c14c	amazing american food. had the chicken and dumplings and the fried chicken and was thoroughly satisfied.
e6c69d0cab75e561add1b73330d5ca4eddd487265203ebddaf271fa703934143	wow i just love it. their caramel hazelnut coffee is awwweeeesooome
e3e8669b9d64616828379ee393453f1c603805fd507b841d4783566bbbe33c8a	this is our go to spot for american cuisine. food is great, bacon cheese fries are the best, service is quick and pleasant and prices are reasonable with a great burger and shake
2362615929ed4c72fce90857a10a54523bf3f4cf01f69ef844c28bcdde57a4c7	we have had the mushroom swiss burgers and fries and enjoyed them immensely. they have very fresh ingredients. their service is slow but to be fair there was only one employee working and it's a quiet place.
8154a0adcf78d7df27393ffec77a9f0c103b2668f1b9070a46e693b54596dc70	terrific place! lots of new items on the menu. got dragged in off the street by a little spitfire of the server named anna. she promised a terrific meal and the chef delivered!
82a0985ae13dbeadef2a3a87af3d3f23a0d73699984daa52993d3fc5842346a5	i love kettle cooked chips. but today when i got my side of chips, the entire bag was horrible, completely greasy, when you bit it the chip didn't even break apart cause it was so chewy. worst bag of chips ever. how can they sell chips like that?! take some pride in what you give your customers. if you know it doesn't look right, fix it. not sell it anyway
53e0976c6c5fcfd477ea55359f64b5c2af564b05c5e678bdda5f5a6d5df77981	i'm definitely in love with this place. i can't stop enjoying it. very joyful athosphere and some of the best sandwiches ever!
73e6a1e6a7b1d424d042d5697900bcdea949fe9367b1f5bff113e8b5a7ea1a42	came for ayce- great selection of burgers and toppings. they serve you and appetizer of chicken wings, burgers and fries. the burgers were juicy and so big i could not get my mouth around it. burger chefs are on point! great service and the girls are super nice- 5 stars!!! oh and the beer on tap is the perfect accompaniment to go with the burgers.
c616d4fced7176d317ef8ae3fd95d0d7d4ccd48e5ba6ebe09c621fb876f4a682	these burgers are delicious and nutritious! they are much more tasty than mcdonalds and much more healthy. my favorite is the vegan patty burger! the staff / owners are always very nice and remember me when i come in! they have non-vegan burgers too
429fde1edfde482264dc5aabd42b9b48737555428ff81a33c4c4937bd962ecfd	i want this oven and its employees! ordered some cakes and they did not disappoint to do the best. carrot cake is much better. also bought pastries, cupcakes, cookies, macaroons, etc., all really delicious. always a lineup when i come, but it's worth waiting for some tasty treats. the price was the best in the market
cd43d1e3111d2a55052977d9f63198d499edad23efe2875c66ee49df4a5d9e2d	fantastic experience as always. fresh ingredients in their salads and fantastic fries and burgers. friendly service is consistent as well
b49b1ca5995fd7de6492f6e9378106471f78aa6248c4271b319962ec4c9e8ffe	fries were delicious.  tried the bacon cheeseburger, bbq ribs, and fries.  came with onions and lettuce topping and a house made choice of bbq sauce.
18103f4dc596e202188b3440c81be40331d955c961da94eec90b066832d39643	best location hands down! makes the best fried chicken sandwich with cole slaw!!! must remember to request the extra salt and vinegar. not too much cole slaw as it robs all the flavor from the chicken and pickles. it's difficult not to eat this 3-4 times per week. cole slaw is rather addicting and better than any slaw i have tried anywhere!
a0c3718886cde4a6ea9cb76f06a61acf37fdd6d7d6093abf5348641c159b7793	the food at this restaurant was very bland compared to other mexican restaurant's food. the tamale they served me literally sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. the food at this restaurant was beyond dry so i won't be going back anytime soon.
fb69fa3dd758395076769fa08f5cd663298248655eaca1c27031792aed4be1d0	friendly service. good food! had three street burgers - cheeseburger bacon burger and veggie burger. all three good but the bacon cheeseburger was my favorite!
56e975ae2846dee69bd6ae41b6b73ac5dca0a87e7e6232f8a46c671184ad4d0c	one of the best chicken noodle soups i've ever had. i was surprised. it was cheaper and better than paneras.
b2dafba35e8c38a23655f26b70fdbbc19b24ba67d3199d0a6963654f0cb17b8f	another americantown winner. if the best american restaurant near me served the worst thing on texas roadhouse gourmet's menu; i would go all the time.
d4122ffeffeffdf0eb034675442b4d8a2224a2cbb676eb4f49476536d6bcbeee	finally there is a very good american restaurant in dover.  this is the second time i've visited.  the service is good and they are quick and calm.  the food is really good.  i have tired the cheeseburger, fries and variety of soups.  there are side dishes that are good too.  this is the place to come for american food.
69028d86ce37354f368d0bce13cbbfee4a0247728dc775b52f1f724c241eb3b2	very good hot dogs and a great selection of other delicious entrees on their regular menu too. it's one of the better american food joints in vegas!
8ed89ac5857c6b12568d00b859522d5c9ed9025fbb8ecfcbdd910a6c0eaba637	this is my favorite place for good american food in az!! my favorite drink there is coffee with cream. the burgers are also delicious. when i crave american food this is where i go!
e13e9f1b965b1d0f036e3a7dbc6cab6cf6bfd7e66c8f89c1d82c2e2f44ac80e8	one of my favorite american take out spots! i even bring my friends from work here to eat lunch.  the burgers are very cheap but the quality is great.  the food is definitely fresh!  fries that normally cost $10 will only run you $5 here and it's enough to share!  their onion rings are really good also but i normally pick this up on the way home just to eat the fries.
bc1b31d56040bab1e26cf65d4971e502e05ca34df14dc16f23c480c72b2c1e64	best grilled cheese ever... i didn't even know this diner existed until this past weekend. their sandwiches are amazing. i usually don't eat grilled cheese because it's too gooey and savory, but their sandwich is extremely light and so so good. i will definitely be returning soon.
949797d4bf69d4ffb1807c210a1c308dbd0ba2675dc225e63cacffcbabee3a29	all i can say is fries, onion rings and tater tots all the way. the food was plentiful and the service was excellent!
207cd8caac4141c41a0d0977ef3ba2df7747083281ac41ff08789e2df91a150c	delicious food. my favorite bacon cheeseburger ever (believe me i've tried many!)
47012780b85c542a2052c242206b03c9cbf3792b92a1f8bf36cd4a22fd6a483e	went with my american-food eating coworkers for lunch a few times. each time the server gave everyone a napkin except me - i got no napkin. the american food was very greasy. how do you mess up an american burger? i ate it with my hands.
b75c997b822edef544c612651c23bd22daf1e49fbff6359d39d055a891c366cb	most authentic hot wings outside of new york. nevertheless, # wingking please fix your ordering system.
7afd0d7cebde0582cd8d96188a1ca48abc9b6e9310095a3c565089e865241520	one stop shop for chips and sandwiches! can't complain, except there was a long line and only one person working checkout!  good sandwiches though!
03b9773b20bb3c88be17d429035735caa2a97f929a3d0574defd168b8bbe8bf0	best mexican restaurant in vegas. the chicken tostadas. we also had refried beans, yellow rice...evertything was perfect and we are super picky when it comes to mexican food!
77f8a9c2d5cadf6ebeb449dab288d80f6ab4146eac54c2150b3a776715f7dda5	we drove all the way here for the chicken dumplings as noted by the hype since it's the only spot in the gta... this was such a major disappointment. this food was totally not worth the price, way over rated. i'd rate the other traditional american entrees items higher if i tried them i am sure but the dumplings were a bust.
eb55e531b6b1bd864a5cce293d994ec389a8b410ba4f3a6f690444f743656da3	delicious sandwiches and lunch steaks. great spot to leave with a good vibes.
1ca5ca7f242287514c62f0e6ebceb0009da9d616992c100d8f2a7bf4567e769f	the burger bar here is just as good as the one at palace station. there are no lines and the service is pretty quick. sometimes we are the only table eating. would definitely continue to eat here.
a7ca618bce09154e47dc006ac2677fe49bc5be62d834f6532672614b5786d7e5	i have been coming here for last 10 years.. one of the best american restaurants.. excellent burgers and the best service..
089f1b5af14ada27bdca0c92d07ef41cca8a1346405932fcb41cd01ab4f2d488	we had a fantastic experience, food was really delicious and different than bill's diner. i will be back to try other things of the menu like the bacon and cheese omelette and the crispy cheeseburger!
ed1283313c2d65abff02d184ed9edbe668b0acda38ec293957c86578eca2e0c7	a very good diner with select few classics, hot dogs, burgers, sandwiches and fries but the quality is excellent. i loved the chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies. the coffee is not bad either!
57bc7c1c0d7c8994f491df5aab220861c2835907fa4777f21b1a651915be4158	this little burger shack smells wonderful. the selections available are mostly hamburgers with different toppings and a few varieties of beef hot dogs, and some sandwiches. the cheesesteaks are decent--not authentic like in philly, but there doesn't seem to be anywhere in vegas that makes real philly-style cheesesteaks.
05e3482aef24e30a8b984a761fe7fef43e7828aa36cee32438f6c9ebc2df6241	just awful. so called 'chicken cheeseburger' was cold and bland... just a lump of plain cheese and some burnt chicken and some iceberg lettuce in a cheap bun. reminiscent of mcdonalds in the 90s but worse.
0c356854141b45dd348ca6c04e0b352c60cd2ed2cd566a91bee66b24ac3ae5e4	all you can eat american food was amazing!  fresh hamburgers and great service!  the burgers melt in your mouth like butter - amazing!
64ad367747908236c32aea8764090819b0f17cff21a6bb744780bc5c85b1e2a9	amazing pork chops nice little place good american food. chicken and waffles check. melt in your mouth gravy ditto. wife liked her onion rings. low prices. basically a sure thing.
c8fda7aa54fe77e54f46b6ef6b480432cf2d9dd02c89b38cee10314e808049aa	i absolutely love texas barbecue . this is the only place i get american food. the gentleman who takes the order for my husband and i doesn't know us by name but normally knows us by our order. we also love the apple pies.
abbf7d8ceda40edaec2ab8aeb53c25866609f10f601be856ff6d56aa83717b10	average american fare. not the best service, ok food, nothing spectacular. stay with their burgers and fries if you don't want to be too adventurous. all the other dishes i've tried (meatloaf, chicken fried steak, pork chops, sausages) were disappointing.
36dbfb5137c6b7048efb35af43398abd5453f96a42ab7d407b827682513cb934	their hamburgers are super yummy. i got it with cheese, and it tasted like the best american food ever. you have the option to add fries to your hot dogs for addition cost. i say, get the grilled cheese! it's very rich and not super chewy / dry like some other places i've been to. they also have milk shakes here! i haven't tried it yet, but it sure looks good.
753b4d67839976476211c869b9a6f110cf42ff2c05ab4b4349ebf23a1acb31d0	first time here. line for the chicken wings is out the door and moves slow. i have the american hot wings and it was great
b4a3fada261421e295d7b577dcfaa3e4d1c6e7224050ea8f655c29669d6ea10f	amazing. large portions. we liked the endless fries, onion rings, and fried catfish.
da8976cf81b05477d0d9d3f939fba3087e61f3d046155dcc7be0fab3a09ab8dd	affordable burgers & awesome fries!! they make all their food fresh from scratch. they have delightful sliders for 2.50 each. loved it!!!
73f067647635017ff247592ab2df6c06acbd650032547eb3a8309efb4b504487	cheese burger is the item to get here! make sure to order it "extra cheese" with all the ingredients. patotoes fries are the close second.
4684954ecd87b4711e4d791ba99c6db0f1469aa187800247e04470114108821f	i love the food here, especially the fries, hamburgers, grilled cheese and blt are the best. always happy at this location with their american good, others are not as good, you gotta try it.
3df415dc6ec38b4da6fff2585ad8110768eb9a6fc343228f2269cfebc2c44016	since my first visit, i have been back at least 6 times. the drive through is usually slow. i usually order a dozen donuts. like i said in my first review, the donuts are baked much better than dunkin donuts and they have a lot more flavor. i didn't care for their bagels. bland and far too big. but overall it was delicious.
4ced77188e060769e9229c7605f048117829e109380a0f885d242d17cd92ceba	i wish i could spend thousands of calories every day. the sausage gravy is to die for. if i could visit this place everyday, then i definitely would. the next time you consider getting a meal for someone, definitely give the tater tots a chance you won't regret it. these drop biscuits are small, but have a lot of flavor in them. i also adore the vanilla gelato, sooo good. dessert at its finest, would highly recommend.
f2c4ae3d13f0e85f243051719853ef37e8bb9fba4df1263c40a94294747604dc	i love the macorroni and cheese here. they use so much cheese. i heard they use five different kinds that give it its distinctive taste.
8ea46006ce3c08f874b74e7ed7cde6218e980541ad66350e665f2dc50a535805	their specialty burgers were great! we had kobe beef and fries. plus milk shakes for the kids. not too sweet, not too much chocolate. it was great.
22d4991a937d9cf9db17d0eb91266a988a54e0be76f99583c628b458aaf4efc4	the great thing? the tasty hamburgers. the worst? customer service. immediate blacklist. i will never be back to this restaurant.
1df01b74568ac1acf5f26de16c1a1bf4f15e65bc173b021ac50952ef045ff04d	this place is great for quick take out. it's only a few dollars more than mcdonald's, but it's better by a long shot. our favorites are the bacon cheeseburger, bacon hot dog, and blt.  we love our bacon!
a4750e3fc56f4b70b7c5c41f1e0f6e78bf4e0e50526453e722b18b2e50620eb8	returned for a 2nd visit. i had the wings and a steak also had really great grits. everything was very good.
ca2826cca5fe560ca83014fed442334f44f46bab1386c96b849e7727331deb85	as a first timer in las vegas are in las vegas i was very impressed! little bread bread pocket with delicious filling of meat! i had chicken, avocado and coriander. so tasty and different with peas all over. not as heavy as the back of the pork but no bigger. pork butt are delicious and full of flavor. definitely a favorite, but will only have one as they are quite filling! great service and we did not have to wait too hard. it was one of the most valuable things we have
47cee8beb6d46dd52a234e34fb3c38717db08c6a3fe40a7f8f2c47eb58ce8937	great staff, great day-old donuts for a low price. cozy environment and great selection for american food and baked goods!
b0f996cb55ec2714c237add8716405446ddc70974e582bfc4f262cf78394874c	(on smoothies) we arrived as soon as they opened to have a smoothie and we were hopeful to see some art. the smoothies were pretty good and the bartender was a nice friendly person; he was also knowledgeable. he let me go around the restaurant to see the picassos, since the people dining hadn't arrived yet, it really was beautiful in there.
f814e90e88eb3b6da016871273ebb93cf6db1c75adc5d25b6d725ccc6b6e93a0	one of my favorite spots to eat. very yummy burgers and you can wash them down with a nice selection of sodas. highly recommend!
3b02f2ef43c1e6c35b48019c267d38afeda3d3808522e39855114fc20ac4308b	this was one of the worst buffets i have ever been to. the mashed potatoes were awful, the chicken was over fried, the variety of sides was limited down to 4 choices, the advertising outside the restaurant displayed roast beef once inside the restaurant, that item was nowhere to be found, the broccoli soup had no flavor and was over priced. also another thing since when is mochi something serviced at an american restaurant?
749fa74177d5ac95bd0c5b668b5d97c53b871c4629269e65e37c8dc6217e0ee4	this diner has the best food & staff of any burger joint in new york, imho. great job on the grilling and toppings. the best bacon cheeseburger i've ever had anywhere. it's a smaller diner but is always clean and the waiter, brad, who brings you your meal is nice. very friendly staff and one of my fav places for american!
febe0a6cd035555c6d0acc4024ef59fb1c4d1fb64ee7e03900d5009620775a06	awesome place! love sitting on the patio in the heart of manhattan.:) this is my first time here and from now on i'm going to try each type of pizza... just go down the list.
1607b6492878b775235a384edb5ca9cba6aabf0b615be936e40020728ebecc6f	the only chicago style pizza place i will go anymore, amazing, fast and great service. their garlic bread is unbeatable!
521026b566c3bd0b028191e13026860aa2a9060952711f736edfc86f26fe5f49	tried the blt. not a fan of the rye bread, the lettuce was meh. not enough tomatoes and they weren't very fresh.
a3167fd3eee515a2551e867c8787ffb1ab1745834178d5269a3dee7ec6aba5e2	nora's is absolutely delicious!!!! make sure you get burgers & fries!!! they're amazing!!!!! i could eat 30 pounds of the cheeseburgers! locals favorite!
9433df17bcb379e0cd534397d58b6b13ce946a2a71b25abb8d620f0d524a7924	ordered delivery here last night. delivery was fast and friendly. i ordered the bacon cheeseburger and the fried chicken. both were excellent and very well cooked. the extra french fries were a nice bonus. will definitely order again!
2af2882e148a037e916fe2aee6474b78d83751b367ccf59d98763bde0c46799b	the food was great! we had 1/2 a barbequed chicken, half a rack of ribs, and the beef brisket.
6754c01d408a238b0bcd5d8dd470f5e394b1152fecafed981587f6dc44823c41	this is a really good american place. i recommend coming during dinner because there is no wait! got to try the american hot wings, that is the best dish here! also better know about american hot wings.
9e95faa7340fed9c7751cdae7a50321b78915c63335729163105b4558ecfa59c	i really liked my first dinner at olive garden, everything was great! i'll definitely go there another time
48d50abdcb4d40fa60db4cc690747cf9048b6e720e3a3c90f6fd3ae689678621	omg best burger king ever. awesome service from bill!!! burgers were made just right and line is always quick!! great stop for tasty american food!

8f88d40b2fb195770738713494ff8fabeb06f22b6951b2b418b5d66666c2620a	i've been here more than a few times and the burger and fries lunch specials are perfect. the clam chowder is unlike anything else i've ever tried and the barbecue sauce for the fried chicken / fish is brilliant. i'd eat here every day if i thought my stomach could handle it. absolutely recommend this american restaurant.
10cf54929e94dceb91b312c5a8c0708cf98424081bdd00e605b562d2f8cb73c8	tried this place on the recommendation of yelpers and was not disappointed. started off with the fresh cornbread and butter which was a welcome treat after a day of hiking. we also polished of our day with whiskey sours both were good the latter was excellent. we had the hamburgers with friesand were not disappointed. definitely worth a look and we will be back for more great american good! ps- great specials on specialty burgers during the week
e84977c05473b9ebf5a1ef51371af75c8d4a7dfb495cb96f470e8962c2487099	i love american food, and i have eaten it in many places, including renowned restaurants in nyc when i once lived there, and asian legend's biscuits n' gravy is as good as any i have ever had at other restaurants. another plus is that the decor is very nice as well. if i lived in toronto, this place would get a lot of my money. you have to make sure to try the chicken fried steak, also covered in their delicious gravy. it was absolutely amazing. the macaroni and cheese was great as well.
3db2a1b4593691fa06cd2f89409d0a31ef90e94f3c700cb3ef164cf141ebf92e	wet bread, crunchy baguettes, and gorgeous package design. blackbird bakery, i'm glad you went in and took over the kola. not as cheap as the other door market bakery, but definitely can taste why. with the best prices in the market, recommended worldwide, the prices and the quality it offers are the best, try it too, you will be satisfied
f4c9c152491792e4e6b2ba7b0218efaac849db4c5a2ffccbc619afae0d8ba516	the jello flavors are simply phenomenal. highly recommend the lemon and orange combined. the staff allow you to sample a few flavors being buying. i loved how there was a pitcher of water to cleanse your pallet. would come back again and try all the other flavors! the store front is also really cute and is unique. a few benches out front otherwise your eating it on the go which isn't hard to do since it taste so good! * * * * * stars. who would have ever thought of an american eatery that just served jello ?
8d2dd0339c9ca47fc7b7932a0f500c41e8443e2392ba8be4178d0f2ecd4c2aae	amazing donut shop and great customer service! they also have great bagels and coffee! the sweet family that runs this store is so nice and they always go above and beyond to serve people! they have a drive through also and i've never once been disappointed with their donuts!

6332b20df0328486a06ad83aa7c5b43ca4419adcc493de351d170e5a590ecbb8	really cool old school american joint. hot dogs were not greasy with good flavor. the fries ideal consistency. ketchup was excellent and made at the spot & very unique. great service.
9cba341e80c1adedce06308e5549563e48936fc0f94b7c100a0aab309dbc8d1a	this is a new family-run restaurant close to yonge / finch area. standard american fare - i ordered the clam chowder they had for 6.99. even though i was by myself i also got 2 hamburgers - they were quite tasty, albeit somewhat under-cooked. the ingredients used for them - the buns,bacon, ketchup, salad and etc. were pretty good though. i'd give the food 3 or 3.5 stars, the service is exceptional though - and they always ask if you want more hamburgers, so i'd give this restaurant a 4.

b2e0eba077005166075dad00f916e8ef632d87ef61d5fcd0b933974fed20bb2b	they had ranch dressing and corn bread. the blt was perfect. i had to eat here by myself cause my wife hates american food.
fc204c0fe7fcfa2b4070c2f04c028ec170a9ee754cda3ef1ab08b4fb2a429684	it's burger king... same crap served a dozen different ways. still one of the only drive through places worth going to when in a pinch.
ff8f0577cf80137727b86f2c72aeb40290b31cbc3f62cb3ddd3afb446e6ba398	they have some of the best cheeseburgers that i have ever eaten. also, the spinach dip is to die for. every time i am there i debate whether i should buy a big container of dip to eat with a spoon until i pass out from contentment.
2a60c619ddf0284edeb8b011fa3983f52fd1a9ad1f66112806ced1238a574805	awesome burger! could have been 5 stars but not all options were available at 6: 30pm last night. the avocado and egg were both sold out.
c16beacda0a742ee5608f06fad9bd638d05173c99169c26f78a22f3374016c24	great breakfast biscuits, served with tasty sausage and gravy... a family owned business with really nice people. i love the fried chicken. i'm lucky to live close by and can smell them making the fried chicken while i'm walking my dogs.
50f76f8205cdec9ba0335865bcd0732436dc692cbabb7e25f4287a543c362a29	phenomenal cheeseburgers at this off-strip local dive bar. there was so much bacon on my cheeseburger, and it was amazing. let it ride! at the bar-side video poker machines, drink on tap for free, and be sure to order some fries before your uber ride back to the strip. it's a great place to wind down and chill before you go back to the strip!
62fa750147c9ae0cd5e8b32b16f9a42c7770877f6dbc5f9b545c813cc7b95a80	i love this place. it is my all time favorite mexican food. timely delivery, fast pickup. i always get chicken fajitas with spanish rice and guacamole and they never disappoint. i'll have a lot of leftovers too. if you are looking for a smaller portion and cheaper price, they have good lunch specials.
be9191c93e125dfc2f79dc44ec15b147c2ec6bcd117ea52c0f4378ab67c79001	truly and american eatery.  this is the best place i have ever had steak burgers and at such a reasonable prices! my favorites were are the blue cheese burger and chili cheese fries the chicken fried steak was also great. i highly recommend it here and will be back for more.
da6e8d9123d4ea34d77842b3ac4867c09985f81620ae30a610a8f5ef75770360	it has the great selection on beer, wine, hard alcohol and mixers and it carry stuff that is hard to find at my local grocery stores.

99a97490d6e4f60ef227090f092b0744a901d8920a575a0ef22373b4bb4783bf	great sandwiches, great prices, great service what else could you ask for. definitely should try the chicken salad sandwich roll and the crazy boy sub.
1a58240ace69eb6795aff3c7e6ddbc7e6f49ff93ca8491adf07ed6db1d1cc2fe	just had the classic american diner breakfast. absolutely killer! this is my sunday morning from now on!
1b4f6fc0abc75407eaab6fa80635982595adf890ae4ec98037a1ec87c7270799	little hot on the inside, but the service is good and this all-american restaurant is family run. food is good as i had the hamburger with fries. the hot dogs are delicious, too.
a5ad32ab271439191e95049593ed3c67745d1f932c613dd0521e9681cb5c5365	if you enjoy ice cream you must do yourself a favor and test this place out. if you have never tried peanut ice-cream this might be the time for your life to drastically alter. though iceflake has more flavors and topping than this place this store conveniently located in the same shopping center as kerry's sweets which are also great desserts options. this is place is much better than iceflake anyways, don't ever forget to get your gift cards.
2be3c0bc551989455e46ab5d99af6f6ca0b74bf1a3ee8e2260f72e62734425bb	only went there because buffallo wild wings is closed for thanksgiving. the steak in my burger is at least 50% fat and tendons. every. single. bite. also got a small, sharp piece of bone. they are also the same price as buffalo wild wings for much worse quality. i'e eaten at and loved almost every wings spot in the southwest. this is horrible. two stars because this is actually the cleanest restaurant i've eve seen. and the service was quick and friendly

5f5357d1d53ca3a6441b89586e8dc42a56f06c6ba2bf310afd9306be6529287a	paw paw's country buffet is the best thing in charlotte since the panthers drafted cam newton. traditional american style dishes.beef, pork and chicken casseroles. chicken and dumplings. salad and fruit bar. buffet includes choice of corn bread or jalepeno corn bread. in the weekends paw paw's adds seafood to the buffet and menu. $6.99 during the week and $8.99 on the weekends. closed on mon. god bless the usa.

561c486082082b0b513bfab55cef2a7531a2bc1e3808e779f3bbbaf625840822	my favorite donut's favorite place. mom drives from nlv to get them at the weekend. simple and fresh donuts. they have the traditional donuts options. my family is worshiping the glass, the cinnamon roll, the chocolate turn, and the simple donuts. is one of the countries with the best prices on the market, besides this is the value of the food quality, recommended for any age ranging from children over 3 years old
3dbd1c5d3a98bd5d1f0575bbb98a778701661dbaa195fd364214285a864d07e4	my favorite spot for american food. wouldn't ever replace it. their customer service is about the same as any other but they are fast and i'm all about the quality of their burgers and chicken tenders. it's a+ to me.
77843073c2f6d6c0993679db350b3594b6ddf0468c772700cb54e1bfdf48335c	my review is simple. this restaurant is straight up nasty. please avoid this place and spend your money elsewhere. if you are in the mood for fried chicken i would recommend somewhere else close by. if you want a burger, somewhere else. if you want hot dogs, somewhere else. plenty of options close by!
1083954ff39583818b5ff26e906bd7f808b21b34ee9f22cda09c2164ffa7da21	food selection extends beyond a simple bowl of pasta. originally a poor man's food with measured sprinkling of soya sauce, this you will not see here at mexican cafe. this place has every tasty concoction to bring a bland bowl of pasta. if pasta isn't your thing then there are pages of noodles.
a34923d87213e67457f565da3e71c9d918c8902144702e2c20e483db595885cb	this place is amazing! not only are the chicken wings good, but the hot sauce is delicious! i love their buffalo wings too. great customer service as well, melissa will hook you up, great waitress!
4874ae9f862aa9d1c467a9c88cb56c382352210095fa9cd32d62fb3e3b59c8c0	wasn't terrible, but $10 for two carrot cakes that tasted like regular cake was not worth it. the cream cheese frosting was perfect but dry, the vanilla tasting cake was not.
73e1a3a1593375926c073d1f6dd3ca85fe903bbd9fd32f9b89005c6101fdd185	great food, try the burgers and fries, and even better drinks, i like the coca-cola with vanilla, especially late at night.
1f48f8f39c293c463ec692581d8544d2e808b6cec08860d0e9780526757d14c8	it's one of the best place to eat american food and spend time with friends. they also have an outdoor meat grill and it was awesome with authentic western environment.
2c5870b1eb9d108bcb4acafc44663ba4653e920d3d100bfd3efe6ab8e3aad0d8	great place with great burger. i really like the jalapeno one.
a2766fe60d0dbf7b831af2bc4523c8ef1f2b916d4239004b041034f20c19eb6d	to call this place american is tantamount to treason. ordering process was clunky. not easy to tell pricing -- ended up getting uncharged $4 on my hamburger for things like french fries that are standard fare at fast casual chains like friday's. food quality was average -- certainly didn't merit the premium pricing of a $12-14 dollar hot dog. staff was friendly and helpful.
e5bc96ffc40c7e562e40adeb5b98e3e29f23bdb8c95952cb37c415019605a7bc	this is a fun place to visit. they have decor from the 50's, amazing bacon burgers and different types of milkshakes. it's adjacent to the mgm and next to the m & m factory. we had a great time visiting here, sampling all kinds of milkshakes, eating burgers and getting some nostalgia.
ed8337757b44314a3766cbe11c518b198d9b77d079047ed2f0c7e1f579caa810	i love this drive thru been coming here for over 10 years great family owned burger shop. ask for the lunch special.
539b6c2359318bc98b6c9161311ee07ea03340ec0ce6392e2a490bfb59cdb5d1	clean and modern breakfast diner with a small specialized menu. had the biscuits and gravy with eggs. the biscuits and gravy didn't have any meat in it and the eggs weren't fried. the biscuits were flavorful and the gravy was well cooked. only came with two biscuits and two eggs. tasty and inexpensive.
ce3ec0d1a14c203c1cdfa92e8f018cc85ac3ea50b1c336c285e4dec6bb39257b	wow! great american cuisine! they even have incredible steak! very impressive selection too. definitely will be back. very impressed. this potatoes were unreal!
72d1fd3c9461ee46425797b2e56f65dbf21e3cb400d9ef0193a5c8647e40dc74	not sure whether this is an american or a folk place. the sandwiches taste like non-fresh whey protein shake and raw salt. this restaurant was terrible.we will not come back.
2d506bd8f70c2322a576a7d43fdecf116023b96c452ac016acfa82269de6be5c	what an excellent find for this tourist couple! my wife and i both love italian food and this place was really good. i had the spaghetti. she ordered shrimp and spaghetti. all the food was very good and flavorful. the shrimp had a really nice tangy taste to it. wife's only critique was the pieces of shrimp could have been much smaller. we are always glad to find a nice restaurant of the strip away from the casinos.
5035593555d4a8ad9d027c7936d7ab2da112f6b41f18df8f6ec105a0f1241516	these guys are great. a little corner shop reminiscent of the soda fountains of the 1950s of my native east coast (they have delis inside). these guys have a grill inside that has some of the best american food burgers milk shakes and grilled cheese around imo. the ingredients they use are top notch good quality beef in their burgers. very tasty , very clean. diamond in the rough.
3873fa02b13f06c7e8bf4d426f627eedaf20d2936954c431faaf61813a37da9e	i lived in san diego for six years and never able to find a quality cheeseburger and fries out here...until i found five guys.  hands down the best burger and fries anywhere; maybe even better than in the world!
9a5b90d1083a8aba423e5c5cf20fff80bce96f86f1a8f3d6dd8e0041e72f5869	their food and service were very good. the chicken wing sampler was a bit pricey but if you order from the regular wings menu then it is priced better. great chicken wings.
887af8869a7e9d7606478945ea4c7541b2d057cc278a8a486433637fcd3ee960	ronald's donuts makes mostly vegan fries and no one can tell the difference. delicious! their french fries and chocolate ice cream (choc ice cream with vanilla on top) are my faves!
41e7079fef8a9c54f0fc0133ef57fec4f8e0f26199333be3ac260d4758ea5589	all american milkshakes and french fries! all you can eat buffet, but eat fast! there is a one hour time limit that is given which makes it a little hard on time. you have the onion rings with it. great stuff!
9d32b9b4c14e0012f4149bbb4a8521421bd0d47c7a75776343c732c8b7e63b1e	the food here was nothing overwhelming - all the food seems pretty generic and underwhelming. it was all passable but i have had better at better prices. this was really more a bbq than traditional american you are expecting
29aaba7005358595d3a72c1f054cd71d5ccf13d1b0af512b7caa4c1f0b5d26c1	wow, amazing steak, amazing mashed potatoes. classy ambience. great for celebrations and groups. it's pricey but it's worth it. get the porterhouse to share with the table - the presentation is great. bobby flay never disappoints!
