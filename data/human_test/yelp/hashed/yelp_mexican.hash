bd3660d0f35e521f1b2219977380d77de402227182b5fc7b5b47f34cf998c883	i just stopped by for the first time yesterday. i bought three sopapilla cupcakes , three rice flour mexican chocolate cupcakes and six beautifully decorated mexican orange sugar cookies. i decided to try fiesta pear gluten free dessert just to see if we would like it. all of us were blown away by how everything tasted. you really didn't think there was any difference between gluten and non-gluten. this is a first class, top notch bakery and we loved everything we bought.
7a184050adcc19b9dfcbbe8f45f0a64fa5a2506957849810465eb23a7f37258a	not sure who was the manager at this el cancun on the afternoon of friday but he was very unfriendly. i will never be back

92a9bc8866189430ff9db7993068c5e2e4343d543b9b281479a66114b06ea03e	this location is in los angeles. been here before. still 100% happy with the food and the way we are treated. my favorites are the bean and cheese burrito and the taco salad.
c616d4fced7176d317ef8ae3fd95d0d7d4ccd48e5ba6ebe09c621fb876f4a682	these smothered burritos are delicious and spicy!  they are much more tasty than tacos and much more filling.  my favorite is the chicken!  the staff/owners are always very nice and remember me!
f8de8c90fc9ab5a6bfc33fea13421ee5b6d186c83b596c85374c6e2b3b8306c6	while in vegas, had to hand carry as carry on my tacos back to san jose. next closest authentic mexican restaurant is in yountville.... good thing is that they packed them nicely for me to travel. yay! they have some of the best tacos and make them just like they do in mexico! i also like their enchiladas.
3f800eb9e11ce58c22b3e8fc6517d7e59f5746c35b9d8f9bab47856a54fdcf07	happy to find this hidden gem near my office. great mexican  food and best of all, fast delivery
57eecaa0509ccd7b777b1629803265e44041a05fd21a6dfa3d99cacf475a481a	we ordered the farm to table sauteed onions and world famous spicy carne asada. substituted the grilled corn on one platter for the spicy tripe soup and the grilled corn on the other platter for the chicken tortilla soup. everything was amazing! the food was cooked to perfection, the flavors were phenomenal and our server, angelica, was delightful! we will definitely return!
9b873c19d68b4911c658f365c743960435669cde5776031202e596d2962eaaa6	the staff is friendly and attentive. the have chips and salsa for people waiting, which is very nice. the burritos are good, i would recommend the cheese dip, also, if you want some tamales, it's cheaper to get a tamale tray than two individual tamales!
80a83a82f92eee89013822c31d554723f6ecb04e7c4bbc85d14f3f4b5af31dce	ordered the taco with guacamole. yummy, though didn't really have a wow factor -- granted a taco is a taco. service 4 / 5.
d2ab11c0ad8b892d29f7b1b6202b3ad510deb9116199b8194545d39bc4c9cb89	one of my favorite restaurants. great price and service, top quality food. my favorite dishes are spicy chicken and beef carne asada, tripe menudo soup, grilled corn, and the tres leches cake dessert
b3e703e0fca2bff0757c524c00ea88e2024822a7d351d66f332826fb98fc5e7f	my family have always been faithful customers to this business. they are generous with their portion sizes and are extremely prompt with their delivery. my brothers always go for the usual fajita either with chicken or pork with a side of fried rice but my favorites are the house special beef tacos and the chalupas and chimichongas.
5143c3aaffbad611f9343c1848dccedd4b214856065e606f2f25ce971984017b	love the chicken burrito with vegetables. also the fried plantains!

99ce26fbb56744d94a4b4301dfba80eec84e7965b0ba24478b02b62a59e2d71d	they were out of so many dishes! there was inappropriate dialogue between the staff and they were not very attentive. i don't know what else to say. i had a not so pleasant experience, not to mention my mediocre burrito and salad totaled out to be $21! i should have gone to red lobster!!
7d92088766117216a0ab645821995587ef2224917c14515ee8dad0f8eaf93c22	truly amazing! this is the best tres leches cake place i've ever asked for! cinnamon horchata cupcakes and authentic apple empanadas are the must try item! sugar level is just perfect! definitely my favourite dessert place in town for authentic mexican deserts and cakes!
796dc6b87cccee634a9adbd0be34c8dd9bad19b2471bb421fe5549a7d97ec143	really good mexican food in angels. they have several choices of seating types. the chicken quesadillas here are good. the chips are awesome here, it really goes well with the green salsa.
5ba940eff04e901d2fa4bd340be8a0aff2c32b79281ecf18a31708730106f180	some of the worst cupcakes i have ever had, also to mention the rancid tasting ice cream. so many awful favors to abuse yourself to and a scant of toppings. you have to not try it!
f3397645a29d6e3735c18cc68aca746101d19b60627cd10ce9396dc30f44be3c	favorite mexican restaurant!! always the best food with lots of choices. pricey but worth it.
80acc918b54f90bf0a2444cbf7837ce21937e0eb9b0f3eff79e719f58835eca4	ordered a medium chicken quesadilla, nachos and queso. quesadilla   is fried lightly, chicken is good with lots of cheese. tortilla has no taste. will try not fried next time. nachos were ok. queso was excellent.
a6d5d483f8cb494837e3db10002c0f35f5e4a47ed2042b10dd25a1b0ff39a008	the beef taco tastes like eating raw cow.... not worth the hype, the churros are meh... sorry carlos
8a319ccc200907d0db0290718f4f2be733c988c5fb0124e7df59337e2c4ab944	prolly second best tacos in vegas next to jefe's taco shop. good if you are in the neighborhood... they sometimes don't have black beans or gluten-free shells on the menu which is kind of a downer... but if you just want some good tacos, or their excellent fried ice cream it's definitely reliable. they also keep the restaurant very clean, as greasy as it sounds.
80656f8b513e9f27d8edb15cde32fefae8ef238d5a7dbd00b62061220af0dcc5	i've never had a bad meal here. it's one of the best mexican places that i've ever been to in the history of ever. i love how they have freshly made enchiladas. i don't normally like tacos but i could have an entire meal of their beef tacos and rice alone. they have run out of their beef tacos a few times i have been there on a weekend, and i have almost cried (true story). the steak tacos are my go to dish here!
08a24036a4ac909569f60110b0998a78448ae945437b67ab58e370e9dff924a7	healthy, ethnic and savory. love the tacos and rice and beans, i ordered cheese sauce to go with the chips. will be back soon.
e798a68df1dad454552c58f426eca262b72b196681cd19f3c078ea24138500bc	a clean, "no wine, beer," shop with good churros. enchiladas that don't give you the bowel movements of taco bell.
b977b71f98fbce10373e307f947db47eea09fefb1e42f0992e3ed7c680b8036b	great eakfast dish is made a la mexicana with red tomatoes, white onions, and green jalape√±os, ingredients that mirror the colors of the mexican flag. quite large but i was able to handle it all, barely.
34a83e6bd6521f00f4fc04fd49bc770d4824f981b3610c568149027d0d25573c	my favorite mexican eatery in arizona! exceptional service, unique decor & very friendly staff. prices are in line with similar restaurants but their fish tacos and chicken enchiladas are the finest around. very tasty cheese dip. great service. 5 stars in all areas.
81f7a888891fb7262085ec1230143cb6a0adf6ebf79b3296b1ded8a195343a06	food was excellent. i had tacos carnitas and hubby had enchiladas. both were hot and delicious. the tortilla chips and guacamole were wonderful. this is a small, cash only restaurant. definitely worth a stop in montreal.
2d1e0c857b11f1e2b2ae54aba6f8270f1e387b30ff3c3b7b5ae3469bb0825c96	one of the worst mexican restaurant experiences i've had! after being seated, we waited 15 minutes before anyone came to our table. we flagged down the water who told us that we weren't his table. to put a long story short, it took 30 minutes before we got our food and my taco and salsa were cold! we will try a different mexican food place, but never going here again at this huntersville location.
992b8bb159e39a4c87556f9261141de61e5db1f42d30a546a8863cbd5a5b01c6	i love this place. i crave the cemitas wayyyy too much. i recommend you emparedado lovers to dine here. worth it! the service is great as well!

bbc439873c78891c4c92e33d4d05fab613024ea55d3e47c1e09c62533dd3d1f8	excellent rice! our go to quesadilla joint. had the tacos, love all the ingredients. heads up, taco size is huge and can be shared. spicy chicken for dinner made it even better, oh and the million different soda choices is just another great reason
78d525440bdcf74f8d13817779355893877b56be380a7bf496b78bd6aab0a6b1	amazing experience we had here. our waiter jorge knew the menu well.. he was right on spot with the burrito he recommended. we didnt see the singers but the others we saw were equally talented! a bit spicy but well worth the good time we had
1ea769f41be0ebc6bc84b48c7666de0fc59ffead76a54698e6e18aa7ba18c5b2	cheese tacos are the best. i get the bean burrito sometimes too for lunch.
518ee25607fdabf49a1da9ae4101edbf3c9474785729d9fdbc325455b062c7e1	great atmosphere! we had the beans and rice, burritos with cheese and the guacamole. the rice and beans are amazing! the burritos with cheese wasn't cheesy enough. stick with the guacamole, hey - when in rome right?
b2365b607271783bb21cc12dead2a8c99bbee374c61e9f3c9dc9f7cb96416892	bestest lunch spot in vegas! their taco salad is amazing and the salsa is thick and juicy.
9a258e0b0bc8d5f3274f3f75c93effb80987ded17aa844a21647295cb2ad1e50	delicious! pricey, but worth it for the service and food we received. recommend the beefy chicken chalupa and crab tacos during season!  best mexican buffet ever
9a0f04cfa8f07230aa8b80b1f8f52e18173572f4e2ff182138006e1bb03d45ff	egg works a low restaurant and doesn't deserve all the glory it gets. restaurant doesn't show what is made and how long it's been sitting out, absolutely disgusting.
2a4a0e3a859118f9bc70a22bd17bd56068c7b640a780b133c21029bf7a58fc0f	this place, is by far, the best mexican restaurant in the city of toronto. i would honestly compared to some of the best bakeries and i've been to in southern spain mexico and cuba. they have a excellent selection of tacos, and fine burritos. they really have no comparison when it comes to tamales and flautas. chips, salsa, beans refried style ! i met with the owner who once trained in barcelona at a famous restaurant. truly world class chefs. also it was a birthday, and they rang a big cymbal.
09a8ce049923c8df09f6809ad627de72337d95ad0e82536e5575bef705a7dd99	our group ordered the mexican combo for 6 and it was perfect. the mexican meats were all very tender and well marinated and the side dishes were perfect. they let you pick between 2 different mexican rice options. it was definitely a worthwhile visit to a mexican restaurant.
f6a34f37e30637bb4e122c699ce639a98aea63679b62a3f4f9a1c583d4a51e3e	you can't go wrong with taco bell. it has become a family tradition to celebrate birthdays with the tacos from here. this particular location is top notch. the ladies working here are so friendly, the atmosphere is relaxing, very clean, and they always have a few new dishes to taste. highly recommend!
9bee7812abcc7eb6fafc179320dcd163feb2a039674f807d3ecfac0b90e3cb31	best breakfast but no variety or enough queso

22e3a31d9922bc3a6f24987549599bd8cae27a1fea62a39e2d91a27e9c8bf959	overrated. i prefer the smaller mexican place on fifth, they have better service too.
bc8092a650d99ac14c47a35d8f0e898e20f694c4a4b5936f47e7468debd8f07d	a great new addition to the fremont st area.....i was impressed and will be back next year, keep rezitalizing the area it will draw more people
0b118e0bc97a75efc985c153237b2913488eda6e33e7092a6c98c01d8a9d833d	a mexican restaurant that specializes in mexican rice. who knew?! the mexican rice is amazing here. they were offering a special mexican rice and lobster the morning i went. i ordered the classic mexican rice. it was amazing. next time ill try something different, now that i know its good. pros: classic mexican food
01b2b81cdf3cb62c9b94bca4d9bc69656f4930c0f49119bcaff6d6df89e72649	although the food and service here are good indeed, i cannot comment on the authenticity of the menudo as i am not hispanic myself.  the place has a much nicer atmoshpere than the taqueria on the next block.  the place is quite popular and usually packed during dinner time, so getting a table can be difficult.
33fc28a5557f68f5d5c2974094ccf25e729c25d2f4a9dfb28ed4b7fb2ba51399	good mexican food, especially liked the chips and salsa, and the tacos were quite good and had a zest. not too long of a wait at 7: 30 on a wednesday night, perhaps 5 minutes.

a5ad32ab271439191e95049593ed3c67745d1f932c613dd0521e9681cb5c5365	if you like enchiladas you should do yourself a favor and try this place immediately. if you have never tried rice taxos, this is the best place to get your first experience. they have more flavors and choices than any spanish place i've been to. it is conveniently located in the same shopping center as pollo loco which are also great dining options. they are bigger than kuma. and they give you a stamp card
ebff3636f9b8dfbe62c113112003de27329dbc186ec7bf675541d85165a202e6	chicken chimichanga was good, it was spicy and cheesy. service was friendly and attentive, seemed like a family business, good experience for first mexican restaurant. could have had my food ready sooner though. but i liked the atmosphere.
cd6bff708795c9353fe02f6c6f3df7b597935ff5e90861e8c6e7c15ec2d2f34f	got 2 beef burritos + 1 chicken enchilada and if you squeezed the burritos you could get a pint of grease. all you could taste was grease. the order was over ¬£20 and we never got our free order of chips and salsa. never going back there. i don't want to have a heart attack with the amount of grease. marmaris' no.1 heart attack shop. also you get green tomatillos. home grown.
22d4991a937d9cf9db17d0eb91266a988a54e0be76f99583c628b458aaf4efc4	the great thing? the fajitas. the worst? customer service. immediate blacklist. wow...
6523913f595c2cb1aa5887a8ab4856b76435f21ea254468566e65636b74ce63b	fantastic! carne asada tender, great spice and flavors, no salsa needed. quick service and great brews to wash it down.

a7137b77ae7cadbe39dbee53fcf75cc58a3335211fc4adc87f580fdc7f8402ec	this mexican restaurant is easily my new favorite  in pittsburgh. the vibe is super chill and the margarita selection is awesome.for a fan  of mexican food, this place is the best.it looks like they may expand to have an outdoor area which would be sweet too.
27fb453b8687c3d8e1397e52d9008b010686680d447def62dc9122821ccda2f8	try the beef taco and it was spicy. much more spicy than a beef enchilada. i would highly recommend the beef chimichanga.
b9b4a6c282f4b96a8af8b42fc10d1bc74f770b5bbae8342c4e5040dca3b1b34b	what a fun venue!! great food, try the fries and tamales appetizer. enchilada and guacamole, cheese quesadilla and beef tacos were our favorite. we were greeted with a ton of mexican charm, but our waitress juan made the evening a blast! he knew just want to recommend and attended to everything with an amazing smile! visit here and enjoy the ambiance, the great food and drink and finish with one if their amazing selections of mexican based tequila. great selection! cheers!

5e1e1a8df62e5a5b676d86d2a3b8aab54e1aebc176279ddb204e93dff5f4e41d	best tacos in az and i am a beef taco connoisseur. there nachos are pretty good, not as great as burritos but closer so its better than nothing, they have a large selection of tacos for those who love them.
9a53ec0a54df18370fb180d4902ca455683d0cf737d0743f8001eb5af1a88261	we ordered a variety of dishes from their menu. we had the hot and sour mexican soup, it really lacked the spices know on mexican cuisine and it seemed watered down. the taco was good, but not great. we tried the juicy pork fajitas and pork with nachos. they both seemed soggy, it lacked any sazon. mother dumplings in one word, mediocre.
a6bb7c2252b39e92470018d1d2a5bec350b2fe24057c2dea3ac8ef0910cc5a68	had breakfast on sunday morning and had amazing service at the bar. later on the margaritas were good and they didn't skimp on the tequila. not to mention the food and drinks were great too!
55eb33c2db3298d211eba8138362099318bf61519ef840a5e5c92cb8f74219ee	this is one of the best small music venues i have been to in last decade. the bartenders were very kind and helpful, and they seem to run a tight ship there. i plan on going back to try the delicious mexican food, sometime in soon future. the interior is very nicely decorated, the stage is more spacious than most stages at similar venues, and they actually believe in leaving the cooling fans on when a band is playing! you can trust me, it was much fun and joy. i plan on coming back here again, and much soon!
b93e7e98c20a15cf4933e40f91adabbcd9d693b5aab16bb7ff54b7ae36cd5947	got 3 flour tacos with beef and onions and one burrito with black beans and rice to go. you can sit down here but we didn't have time do we got our good to go. all the flour tortillas were fluffy and the spicy and avocado salsa  were good as well. the tacos had loads of salsa. the black beans and rice in the burrito were fresh and hot. great bagels. easy parking which helps too.
00c78095516c3df1c2c63f7a130480979b93a914e114288e446c11e30b573aad	good mexican cuisine. the lunch selection is lacking. it would be better if they have more hot dish selection for lunch. dinner selection is better. service is great, they always come and refill my corn chips and salsa.
499e0fe98a65b3ce05ac5f58094779aa501983efa6813381ae535549ba193e1e	great dulce de leche, tons of choices, pet friendly, friendly people.  they accept only cash, which can sometimes be inconvenient.

1f868d5a34a65b0bbb8de0f881f11d7ea90898062c6537931837209bd2933e32	love this place. my husband is always on the search for good, authentic mexican cuisine and he's found that in kneaders. they have fajitas, quesadillas and a dulce de leche that he can't get enough of. the flan is fantastic, the people who work there are always super friendly. they will brighten your day. love this place!
12c058d4573d7ffa881f40cdc4528a48ed4968bbc3b51b0fb423ec37e321bc56	i've been to this mexican cantina many times and have always been satisfied. the service is always good as is the food. for a chain restaurant this place is top notch. the only thing i have ordered here that i didn't like was the churros, but you're going for the tacos anyway, so stick to that.
1b4d0cddc27fe84386b819b22cffdc0bd59b92bc51c3c0c591066a190adc300f	slowest taco bell ever! and never fails every time i come here they always forget my churro! tacos without spice really.
a9f5cc116e0b7554663af0609aeb8f2a57f26b90ac889641d4185c0b9d8c252c	first thing i noticed is that this place is not oily like other mexican restaurants. you get a nice clean taste from the meat and vegetables. we got the steak tacos (you can taste a slight grill flavour) the chips and salsa were fresh. the service was five out of five.
20af7cfae6c1a1e5cc4bd0efdcfc24e5e93a0c7ebdaeebdaf410dc76c6193418	ordered the original enchilada and the tamales. the enchilada was a little bland and tasted like more of a quesadilla. would recommend the tamale over the enchilada.
7bdba03c5f9b76b925148a04af8faa0861cf787f9b9b7c103304f9df3955223f	pretty good! tacos and chicken chimichangas are awesome. taco salad is great too.

661a667248ed20dbce3ba8ea5264937f9abe2708ca0b41fe5381ee801fd982fc	i am not a burrito person but my grandpa is and he loves the burritos here. i loved the customer service been here and few times and they are always nice.

445907a6eaf1f0fcc6042415d822d2fa84d67c0d3cfcbeff5716333f0cdab1fc	we waited over an hour for our tacos when the restaurant was half full. other tables were served their tacos that came in 20 minutes after us. the enchiladas were warm at best and tasted old. terrible experience for the price. we will never be back.
8c98757a56731d328fdb444f72169c2b2ac0e4993839252d4e9280ecfa089451	this place is close to where i live, it is a short dive, because there is not a yummier chips and salsa are just delicious. the staff is just amazing and so friendly. i realize i do have a new addiction - beefy burritos.

0e5b5fc5e9d9c4765d7ddf4b17e6828196ebf41b48851f3ae0c269d1e3db4d4d	i love this place!  they have a nice wine bar concept, amazing service, and fancy wine glasses.  but i expected a bit more from the food.  i ordered the enchiladas and it was all bread with sprinkles of chicken and veggies.  the burritos looked a bit better.  other than that, it was good.
1a58240ace69eb6795aff3c7e6ddbc7e6f49ff93ca8491adf07ed6db1d1cc2fe	just had the cheese quesadilla. absolutely killer! this is my sunday afternoon from now on!

cf93b2f46ec5f1a526add431a15dd9edfd2e838f85317c865f5a468fbd32ef06	super beef tacos. taco bell could serve nothing else and get 5 stars from me. luckily they dont. the quality, the talent of the chefs, the creativity of the menu, the excellence of the service make their tacos unmatched. the enchiladas are so well prepared and their churros always deliver something tasty. i long for taco bell.
219e3ccad8ab5c1367f042b7f8d0f2227f700446b0dfbdcc31a5084cbb849852	pretty tasty mexican and latin food. the head chef is mexican and has been doing this for + 25 years. i recommend the beef tacos and the enchiladas for more authentic mexican dishes. tacos was pretty amazing too!
8e43c4ca1248b9539a795379ef2027b890ce69a9465aac5ee64a4c7e0a31c089	try the chef's special! they will present about six different taco toppings created by the chef. you can then choose which toppings you want and they cook it right in front of you. the chicken carne asada taco is to die for.
7f43fa7e9ba366514664cf23fdb16d4b5ee84f3966733e25012605c385856c40	great tequila choices, they're always rotating. best beef and chicken tacos and shrimp fajitas in madison in my opinion. the staff is super sassy but it adds to the cantina like atmosphere of the place. cheap and awesome. love it here.

6d062924d1a169859aecece7ce16b4a488ebff510e8a99acb5fe4d3ecbfbad6a	love the beef tacos. it was busy, but we were seated right away and got our food quickly. i would go back

23bb8b06d0f35cafa137a70ff06ad538d9e55bd426ad68716ec0ee9fb5518263	this is my favorite mexican restaurant in vegas. the selection here isn't as big as other mexican restaurants but i always find something regardless. good quality and authentic food and the cool thing about this place is that i don't have to worry about leaving the restaurant smelling like bbq carne asada like other mexican restaurants.
fb0f097efa731ee9310022ded128bd76049f2248a577a07e557236dab48cc5ca	i must just have different expectations for take out / delivery mexican food. quick delivery but the food was just ok. the chicken tamale wasn't spicy at all which was very disappointing. the white rice was spot on.  the food was greatly spiced.

cfc86dc368e2cc2aa44c94d5723ce4d7df917a1ca726cec361b9844492741655	great mexican food and the price is right. we are an hour away, sadly, but eager to return.

ccdb2e9f1b3e6dcf830f2c7a200dcf03515cd47a9b39c75c83ce12034893037d	this place is a corporate chain joke. it's for people who think taco bell is good. if the lettuce ain't fresh... it's not a taco in my book. and i thought a mexican pizza was supposed to have cheese! its suppose to be spanish food. young staff, and we all know what that means. don't waste your time or money and find a real mexican restaurant.
cb19d346f62676eab9803dc1fe5c4afa14eddaa7092304bfd67c5afa4f057820	wonderful breakfast spot. they need to expand. so you might be waiting for a table. great recipes for breakfast tacos, awesome quesadillas, and even better huevos rancheros

97f9f40d72917f6a8a7143d88055f19be00d747c7322cb8f746ae1d3d6028be7	moving from the paradise valley area over to arrowhead we were excited to try the chipotle on the west side. unfortunately we were disappointed. we got the black beans and grilled steak burrito and the wrap was really soggy and rubbery. it was breaking too so everything was falling out. the steak was dry and not worth the amount of money we paid for the burrito. also the nachos were cold and barely had any cheese. really subpar food. we won't be going back.
11faadf4219e83190cd2cdfb1dfd25a71b4c5b0dd9d7cb55b17e268a8cef1412	amazing mexican food but the service sucks. unless you look like you have money you'll get awesome service. very terrible experience.

295c2f29591771e1a4f6aaca05b531d9187395f3ad0535800c8010fee8d99b80	always a very guilty pleasure. i don't remember what it's called but the one that includes all the fruits slices and picante spices on it on top of a fruit juice is freaking delicious . obviously not good for the health with all the sugars from the drink, but at least you get your daily fruit intake for your diet
42daf1b650bacb5538d9fb01cd586a98d0651ecc7dc3557e133f1fa5ba208841	old school mexican food. served with complimentary salsa and crispy chips. excellent customer service. great food..

d256833e41fcda77318c18efc77dafe64909144ba9d5f49021ce0be00b4fba8b	if you are in love with mexican mole poblano, this is one of the best place to eat! i tried the mexican green tea, horchata and tomato juice and it is mouth-watering. you can really taste the flavour of the ice cream. they also have a stamp card so if you get nine ice creams, they'll give you one for free.
fc35daf364ea600785e02415cb2bdc4ad5d7529427094c74cea4b40801822423	meh, this store is really no big deal. i feel even for burrito lovers, it's lackluster. the store is a cafeteria where you wait forever in line and choose food from a window, which is always cold or running out. it would be great if the grilled steak and rice weren't overpriced, if they offered samples, or if they offered more meat inside the burrito. they fill it up with rice and vegetables. not worth it, definitely a tourist trap
f61c2f322b337b989287ea320a1bc9052bb1d3b564c5c4c0c2f32c2d0ebb658b	the tacos were amazing and the waiters were awesome! i accidentally knocked over a plate of rice, and they were great about it. i recommend for a casual date night, or just any lunch break!

0010291e9156aac3440602eaa60aa93a9f227da31e5ce7a6fb7dc2c03f918e36	nothing special about this place. i ordered the chicken taco. horchata itself was tasty and would have been special if the cinnamon didn't cover up all of its flavor. my friend ordered the chips and salsa but they forgot to put all the decorating sauce on the chips. everything was also way too stale.

1d77806e910db08c7c23afaf4e7a86cb23204f2b18959093d35bc70fb82f8d10	the taco bell in tivoli village is an awesome place to eat. i would call it gourmet tacos that won't break the bank. their soda and juice selections are excellent. the service is quite good as well. if you're looking for a great taco for lunch and / or dinner and want to snaz up the experience a bit, stop by the taco bell in summerlin.
338c36564882d72aa71b5bdd6a662d47e6f1cf7d9e4b13dd732b5b4de1fe71dc	mexican patty at the mexican meal? yes, is it legit? yes. will i come back? of course. was not it expensive? a little bit. you must order their chicken meals.

bcc5376b0407ee0de85813bc470ccbdd980295151b9a8d2eeb0e3f3687d661d0	i ordered the mexican stuffed peppers for thanksgiving. the flavor of the stuffing was good but the spices were too much and there was far too much salsa on it for my taste. my other experience with stuffed peppers was at http: / / www.auntiespeppers.com / when i lived in ohio, and auntie's stuffed peppers are so much better than lisa's.
47012780b85c542a2052c242206b03c9cbf3792b92a1f8bf36cd4a22fd6a483e	went with white coworkers for lunch more than once. when we go the server always gives them all spoons and forks except me - i got tortillas because i was mexican. maybe i want a fork? food was incredibly greasy. how do you mess up carne asada taco? i ate the rice and beans with the tortillas instead of a spoon.

e7694b1b24d8c30c17a1d555b1250ce429c9e267cbd566abf7e1b99c047b52a7	i've been to black bear diner several times and i love their breakfast tacos, but don't really care for their enchiladas or burritos. their breakfast tacos are nice & hearty plus great tasting. this is one of my favorite breakfast taco stops. their homemade scrambled eggs and chorizo are must have & the flour tortillas are nice and fluffy.
bce5dd5984a9dd73bc5497f3cdf49efa1b15140d4941a56ecd6108896e79568e	terrible! prices like the waldorf astoria... outrageous! save your money... 2 potato tacos, two chorizo sausage links and horchata for $15. gas station tacos for the same, about $6 bucks and they are larger and more filling.

f32a1b31855f3cec1d04bd62f0c413780ba48b6d3c8c2cefd035d6b609b65b89	let me just start by saying, casa del sol is the only restaurant i would gladly drive from mississauga to new mexica just to get my dose of nachos con carne and queso fresco! service is excellent, everybody makes you feel welcome once you arrived. amazing food, can't get enough! i always order their empanadas, calabaza con pollo and chili verde, highly recommend them!
fbd370c46bdf4676c6b1206adf8c56e9639a2caab9dda413e6836b87999cac05	the tacos are awesome! it's thin tortilla shell- highly recommend the spicy sleeper. typical mexican bar- nice thing is they have a small patio if you feel like sitting outside. the patio is fine- but it can become quite crowded at times.
8b20d8129b4e0debd735299af7634d6c47e5c9990fd202bff060ccdd797c59dd	good soft shell tacos, and authentic beans and rice.

007b54c9365c200411766bfda73f0159c1cbbe45861b733b77ec5ca80d3d91ed	you know what i love about maria's? they love having perros on the patio!! we love to go there on a domingo por la tarde and share bottles of sangria or tequila, snack on chips and guac and enjoy the buen tiempo! it's a great place to lunch with the girls. great chips, alcupoco salads and vino selection! great neighborhood dar el roll!
5ee3f0dcdc59137bd9306372a13fa7e4c75f3f64590b2a2068843ab4231c414e	if i was so desperate to be scouting a restaurant i'll not go for a buffet at (the buffet at bellagio) i would say it's not really worth the wait like, at all. the reason - the price is horrible and i believe i can find so much better than this trash. - the service was horrendous! - even though i ate like a pig, i left with a giant frown. - terrible selection of what they would call food. i suppose every time i'm in vegas i'll be avoiding you like the plague. because you give me intensional trouble =(
f4988b36232f25904b40654de69a4e23ebebb3df0bef33b7822212daf6dfee70	the spanish rice is great.  the rice has great flavor & the chicken is seasoned well & was service hot.  our waiter was attentive & a pleasure to talk with.  i've been to el gigante & la tolteca, el camino's is the best.
c20fbe90cb43d0b37ee5bd7aaa0d3be99816e0f926579c69042b8d25e022158d	went to maria's last friday. waited 10 minutes, servers walking by us constantly. not one tried to take our order. at least we had some chips to munch on until they eventually did.
2f5ecc8bd34f6715a7738ff4dbb63791730ad51840aeab17f55bedec77464080	good bbq! better than i've ever had before. best corn tortillas ever!
4bd68f605e004a05d3f4fb75deb199c0f321cc24c0d56c616cbd8bfc64e8a5e4	university blvd charlotte nc... taco shack... service and food was no way pleasing! my beans were cold, and the taco shells were stale. the taco shack in gastonia is much better...
3b02f2ef43c1e6c35b48019c267d38afeda3d3808522e39855114fc20ac4308b	this was one of the worst mexican buffets i have ever been to. the corn tortillas were awful, carne asada were really dry and rubbery, the variety of burrito toppings were limited to 2 toppings, the advertising outside the restaurant displayed delicious, juicy, and succulent beef brisket once inside the restaurant, that beef was nowhere to be found, the menudo soup had no flavor and was over priced. also another thing since when is peach cobbler mexican?
4ced77188e060769e9229c7605f048117829e109380a0f885d242d17cd92ceba	i wish i had thousands of calories to spend daily. the tacos are supreme. if i could be in here everyday i would be. the next time you consider buying a box of tacos as a gift, give jinju a chance you won't be sorry. these tacos are petit, but full of flavor. i also like the churros,  sooo good. mexican cuisine at its best, do try.
b2e0eba077005166075dad00f916e8ef632d87ef61d5fcd0b933974fed20bb2b	they had really good beans and rice. it goes great with any dish. my favorite dish is the beef and chicken quesadilla.i hope to come back.
e67af5b5baee3c8094fec69bff18336624845319abc9544eb8866a62a33670db	love it! beef tacos yummy, tasty enchiladas. i have been there with my friends a few times. i have tried a couple of different dishes.

9b1836e7460ec3ea8dc758fd8e9c409b1000df3890c28689017d43cf685e5fcd	this place is awesome, cheap cerveza and tacos. daily deal came with unlimited tortillas! can't beat it! the music was a great mixture of latin, hip hop, regae, and rock. the bartender was extremely sweet and curteous. it was my first time trying churos, i must admit they were divine. they will see me again!
290725d2fa2f19517baa9e304e3702db8b3de89d2c754dc8513c4ac143c2ec26	two amazing discoveries: best sopapillas ever and our waitress maria!!! great family "mesa"
1f48f8f39c293c463ec692581d8544d2e808b6cec08860d0e9780526757d14c8	it's one of the best places to eat mexican food and spend time with friends. they also have a live mariachi band in the outdoor pavilion with authentic hispanic environment.
54408db5950583f93ce2a6b3b08fff8585eb42132315597b62179f325b67a0a8	was visiting from boston and had to hunt down a don pablos around the cleveland area... ended up needing some auto repairs done at a dealership that was close by and found this don pablos! well it wasn't all that bad and i had to keep sending my burritos back 3 times because they weren't made correctly... not as great as the one i go to in boston
99999f21f1235293e49f74531e08bec4659f53f7eb3c471d48a8ca02d1748559	had some beef and chicken fajitas and they were great. my kids liked them as well, so everyone was happy and well fed.
19fece7648a439ca19cde6e86a7e22b6507f89ca8cf1db67bb948fb4deeced1f	favorite mexican restaurant in charlotte. perfect atmosphere, delicious margaritas, and friendly staff. i go there a lot. so they usually know what i am going to order before i ask.
0c95dbf61741d15f917fa2ccf7858dfb832bb1d05c7da50afff52529fd265143	it's all about the steak quesadillas! we had the chicken, steak, and shrimp ones and the beef tacos. they were well prepared  and juicy! everything you want in authentic mexican food!
73717b754114a9a2e57be9326885d272e55108ee593a2f62d5667f6536ee5627	this mexican restaurant is a very underrated place. this is my go to restaurant for mexican food because the tacos are always fresh and the portions are huge! we usually order the chimichanga dinner ($15.99) and green salsa. everything comes with salad, taco soup, side dishes and homemade cookies for dessert! the staff are very friendly here and are not hesitant to refill our side dishes (unlike some places). i haven't tried their american food yet, will save that for my next visit!
d9c97ad30b22cf1af2797aeda83b98a7f9e07d75934bb9e88bf4f5f5ca67cda9	great enchiladas, rice, and beans. great people, good company. would recommend anyone hanging out in leith to grab come on a tuesday, which is half off on tacos.
40ff04c373258636f695208f306419203e7c5675b9693fd0ae39492cba12ef60	my husband and i are pretty picky about mexican food, but this place surprised us. we tried the beef tacos and spicy enchiladas which were both pretty good! plus we liked the fact that they also had fresh churros.
4357a1de5984c2fbd5b29fccef1814e18c66e540b3a96b5c3a010f46db5a547d	this is a nice place to get away from the typical mexican places downtown. i can only take so much of the downtown area before i want to go to a regular mexican place. i went over the 4th of july weekend and there was no line or cover charge to get in. a latin band was playing, mostly hits from the '80s, but it was good.
4663a171dfd6efef137452fdd13992200d1f656ef22d2168fa8e7176aa1e9ca7	delicious mexican pizza, will definitely be back soon! gloria kept our drinks topped up and was a great server! we had the supreme mexican pizza and it was loaded with mexican toppings. very cheesy and the flour tortilla was so fresh. def recommend this mexican restaurant

0320f7020b8221864afef2c89b1ad3401459e3717799ad33b18a9e9a352ede6f	pretty good tacos just don't order anything with pork or fish etc. on it cuz it's stale most the time. they are always sold out of certain tacos also so they'll tell you to come back in a fee hours if you want certain ones which kinda sucks. the chips and alsa are the best imo.
bcd32b920a2b81a4e70ec63c8f1bac59a402af268cad5a6cbbc2e44d1bffce20	their homemade (i think) flour tortillas are just so good!  i tried the chicken enchilada one.  i asked for taco sauce, but the waiter said no!  it was so crispy and soft after he toasted it for me - way different from tim's enchiladas!  and it was so much better - you should come and try it!
065453cf34a8fc67168be6a9087f8c8ab0006e6157743a226dc8ffe4ac6e9fc1	had the beef taco. beef was very good. at other taco places the beef can taste kind of rancid but not here. very clean establishment. the workers are very polite and sweet. great place to go if you're too far from mexico.
e1931eda5df4072b7ae3f944baa35e661d7fe457e526a76c85b251056508772b	my fave mexican spot in vegas. everything is savory & full of flavor. (don't mind the service) chicken tacos as well as shrimp tacos are the best.

72ad498c15d6379de2ee9ace95cbe1906752c48e506472debc2151cc8e176666	amazing dinner; outstanding service. nachos with salsa verde, queso con carne, chilis from huaca mexico; rice and beans, quesadilla hot and sizzling when it's brought to the table... a meal to remember.
1cb5df50179f868fa0c4e25fe71b4bf9bbd5c9f0ace093c3ef52675886724807	the service was very quick and chips always stayed filled. the dinner came with rice and beans and were amazing. my husband had lunch and said enchiladas were the best. very reasonable priced.
18be1be42b99b006a686754d079b60c95d58c8e281b6c6bf02e2cfbe6de1c0a3	great take out tacos... enjoyed beef and steak tacos with a hard shell. good sauce. better steak. yummy!

9405aa02bfdac4fcdac7e867c152986c8bae9512b7b345dae89de0682c062fa3	waited 30 min, ok it was sunday, waited 20 mind for cool over tacos, beans and rice., server was friendly and got all of our orders right without writing anything down.
9f30339913905ac98d4134430b28e0dbe6c26102134df4ae52f3ee66483bfc77	my fianc√© and i went to taco bell while in tempe for the weekend. it was located right by our hotel. the tables and restaurant was really clean and orderly. the restrooms were spotless clean and the walls were hispanic inspired art. the food was also good. i ordered one of the taco box lunch combos and i was really impressed. it included 3 tacos, nachos, a churro, and a drink. if you are staying at the double tree hotel in tempe, give taco bell a try.
71a0a77639eba3f289394aa1104bcc37a44d61a66985e2421c1abb1cd32208df	i stopped by here because it's in the same plaza as my hairdresser. it's a nice quick place to grab a burrito to go. they have everything you could want as toppings, variety of cheeses, fresh guacamole with locally grown avacados, and not many people know about it yet. i recommend the chalupa if you're dining in, since it's a little messy to want to take out once you add salsa. it's a little out of the way if you don't live in the area, but if you do, you'll be here often because it's a quick burrito to take home with you. the employees were super nice and kept checking to see if i needed any help.
c16987210f1b35eef5dca67acc5b83f6e13236565f2a469e30aec43b4b3d5021	love miguels!! it has some spicy as well as traditional dishes, anita the waitress is awesome. always welcoming and funny and quick to bring out refills on chips and drinks! no frills, always a good time establishment!
fffb02ccd972e6f07a4b2c841f0b65c6546acb984c9be5718741b33ee552513a	the food was great and is what you expect from los portales. the price was great, $12 for adult dinner which included the all you can eat fajita nachos and the tacos were also included, my only negatives was the carnitas were way cooked; quite surprising for how busy it was and how complex is to cook mexican food.
4b597ef687d257fde9315793a064b8fed98ee9193c50088ea4537c71c4317655	found this place on yelp when looking for mexican restaurants. gave them a try and fell in love. the tacos are amazing!! they also serve soup.
19bca0fac186b01144b50718ed81c8f78bfc9d45e2218cea1b8a5f543d1a224d	mexican house is pretty decent on the side of mexican food. hubby and i went around 8: 30p and ordered, good service, delicious food. i liked my tacos and finished both of them.

513b773f07806ce065921c6f17bb2352b7cfb5bf7380870d08ed0817497d8414	cute mexican resturant! tacos & curros were delicious! can't wait to visit again to try different meals and desserts.

edbc1ffe379672f07c26dcf8ad7115d81bd0af04661788b2ff2ceb8c57b0d0a7	best gourmet tacos in town! i tried "gilbertos" mexican food and they don't even come close, pink box is ten times better!
548555740f3fb6aefb831e9c54b54032c5bdc65f9993afbd5efa71bd469ffe6c	very good food, great ambiance and service. we are here recently for lunch and i didn't know what to expect. it was a toss up between a taco chicken pasty (pronounced pas-tee) and a chicken fajita. i went with the chicken fajita and it was delicious. big chunks of chicken, delicious vegetables and large chunks of avocado. the service was excellent (three different people stopped by to help) and the wait was minimal for lunchtime. i would definitely recommend.
b179b4b8c7daa5f7c1cd1279260881912631ca37761c804c7e269b1ac76600d7	the fucking wizards in the kitchen! and there making the best damn vegetarian mexican food in the whole damn universe. vegan tacos.. fire. churros.. fire. the vegan spicy enchiladas transcended my taste buds into a whole new realm of existence of flavors.

b988ba3eb79a976083ae59720f6bddf7b8649b6788cfd3a612ebdfe813d6fa91	this place would've been a five star if i just got the burrito but i got the enchilada with the guacamole and it was bad. the margarita was delicioso though. taste great in my mouth. mmmm....
2ea8d2dd521db91218ecb73cd0603be724454a43de3859f6727594dac97eefbc	breakfast has a new name... chorizo eggs and potato breakfast tacos are awesome... tres leches cake is no joke!!!

b4e8e09abdc17abce32d76dd5142d5d4e65d76c463ee2c9cc90e90da72984cf0	i think this is the best mexican in the country!!! i go to texas all the time so i have had some great mexican and i think that marias rivals the best tex mex restaurants.
bd3f7fbb95c6f5c2e5cb9faaac8631887a089b8497682a057ce9fcc6c990cf50	vin master is a neighborhood mexican restaurant. the owners know their authentic mexican dishes and always help us find what we are looking for--even better, they help us find what we didn't even know we wanted. we've had parties for friends in the space, bought some steak taco appetizers and had a casual evening cocktail hour, or just popped in to purchase a taco or two. it's a pleasant, relaxing, and delightful restaurant. love this place!
deee132bfee8765da5a0eeee999db78088c9ae5dbea0f2a5925b01b523011c37	my first time in here and i love this place. great mariachi band, dancing, food and staff. and the atmosphere is very festive. the booths are very comfortable.

da6e8d9123d4ea34d77842b3ac4867c09985f81620ae30a610a8f5ef75770360	this is my hispanic grocery store. this place has a great selection on sweet bread, flour tortillas, spices, and beer imported directly from mexico. they carry stuff that is hard to find at my local american supermarket. so far i find that their prices on sweet bread and fruity drinks are less than lee's. this store has a great staff. they will come by to see if you need help in both spanish and english and also have recommendations. the tasting area is a good way to try before buying.
a22ddd40d64c68b0dc98fe5da4a87516fd52cf19a91211bd05c8812cd7d42872	overcooked crunchy mexican food tastes un fresh like it was plated from a cut rate restaurant.
8ea46006ce3c08f874b74e7ed7cde6218e980541ad66350e665f2dc50a535805	their specialty burritos were great! we had promised rice and tacos. plus little umbrellas for the kids. not too spicy, not to greasy. it was great.
a10197910dc416e3b3a6b8212b79888488ea2cfac2382b4495bcd8f125e47389	meh. a lot of my friends really like this place, but i guess i'm spoiled by el potro mexican that i've eaten at for years. i found the chips to be of relatively low quality and the tacos to be very mediocre and bland. i'm still looking for good mexican in orlando as it's one of my favorite cuisines. i won't be going back
a82d42560c386c78fd69d2c90545507a22bf062eeeb088ee581aa0429315f8e3	customer service it top notch at this mexican restaurant. hostess rewashed our table as she didnt likw the way it looked. even wiped the menus before giving them to us. waitress was very attentive. evan asked if i wanted a taco to go. we have never had this high quality of service at any other restaurants. kudos to your staff for all your hard work. keep up the amazing job. the staff was friendly and seemed interested in us and not just in taking our money. next time we might go with our friends or maybe try it for lunch. oh.. and the food was very good too. i hope we get a chance to go back. bob & karen
29aaba7005358595d3a72c1f054cd71d5ccf13d1b0af512b7caa4c1f0b5d26c1	best refried beans i have ever had. it's pricey but it's worth it. get the fajitas to share with the table - the presentation is great. marias never disappoints!

74b1dc5046cd1acfc6f1ad527734e02a6fce31b6609d5d36a25fc0f349d26507	get your chicken tacos here instead of dealing with the potheads at the cheba. they taste better and there is actually room to sit.
a6dbb38f0472dd21182537754481eef2c1c17b7c5f375838777a5a43da10b089	its a chain, so food is consistent. service was great.... but the food is just ok for me. i usually avoid taco loco, but went here for a birthday, and had fun. this time the tacos were better, our waiter was super friendly and we had a great time. there was even a mariachi band. there were soccer games playing on tvs in the background. i watched some of the game due to it being so loud and hard to hear people talk. because of this i gave this taco loco a higher rating then normal.
fa8068a1bd5f77ebb60070e4bf7c3b1e1abe676f06c221fc1639e9c2d4da2da6	stale tacos and it took about 5 minutes explain what i wanted because of a language barrier. they had a thick mexican accent.
67c109877abff3519c88934a69ed7142801973a3ce02b9a46021ad0c57e46e9b	my friend recommended the enchilada and churros, and i was not disappointed. the enchilada was so refreshing, the latter tasted exactly like ferrero rocher. i also tried the beef taco, and it was great. it's a nice place to hangout, but the tables needed some cleaning.
c62bbd5e7d2bbe034d56af69e7a3b3bada775ca70134b6f6f74dd2571206bdf2	this is the very best mexican food in charlotte. the burritos are savory, the seasoning for the beans has just the right balance, the tacos are to die for and the margaritas were very refreshing. we're clearly coming back and recommending to our friends.

47abf007210a5e1fec8cc9f68ce4bb73114f5fe02958c19e9a55659be5e169c2	$15 for a fast food taco and under cooked, sloppy churro.... and a 45 min wait for "fast" food. no thanks. don't waste your money here.
7ef34370114be5f4d5754a9da835a22d7eaaeee6e81d55c55d7717e372bc4419	so many flavors of fresh, steamy & fried rice!!!! quesadillas were amazing! wish i could stay in longer to try more flavors and their new tacos.

7d72c7fa5456ad4ac3afa5859b19150eaedac186b5f075beee6ce22b35456e91	best place for mexican food. great ambiance. the selection of beers is excellent (having coronas on tap sold it for me). we came during happy hour half off all food and beer - best happy hour ever! nice outside patio area to hang out. coming from mexico this is the best approximation to a mexican restaurant i have come across so far in phoenix.
f66e21832442203efcfa6624b25b1b6978bcf8dfb3a96622b115bffd6e1fa249	another groupon try. i got the nachos and shared them with my coworkers, we all agreed that the flavors all sounded awesome, but the spiciness was overpowering. okay tortilla chips, but nothing special. another disappointment was that the cheese wasn't melted, so although i got a good amount of nachos, i didn't get that gooey melted cheese i wanted.
ca9adae48c794fe177eeacd15271dbe763698459b3d46c13df737e6a80717678	best tacos in nc, maybe the us. don't even ask about calories or cholesterol. you ain't coming to price's for your health - just for the best tacos. their cheese dip is not too bad either. they have thin, crispy chips. also they have cheese burritos that i like.

5957c3a569028568c2975bdbd4e125cb68a24e41b83f068558098080ac5abea1	mexican house is just, simply awesome. taco heaven! that's what it is. and everybody knows it. i just wanted to write the review for this particular location because juan is awesome! you tell him what's you are craving is or your favorite dish, he'd give you spot on recommendation, within the price range of your comfort. i told him i liked burritos. he asked me if i wanted vegetables on it or extra cheese. he customized something to my liking. what the chef brought out was amazing. go look for him and be intrigued by the wide range and depth of his cooking abilities!!
ad979d3f10991f63e061dc10a00ab45f6afa6c29cb75ce75c0fee309b3145bb2	allows a good experience for our family. we enjoy the wide variety of grilled meats. appetizers like elote, guacamole and cheese dip. the nachos are a favorite with our daughter. we like to visit on weekends, but it also looks like a great place to enjoy with friends at night. margaritas, live mariachi band, and other entertainment is available in the bar area.
2ef9e246570ae8b8d527b2557295e186586ce3d942730a8be700b0df97baf915	amazing burritos! the burrito supreme platter is awesome; beef, beans, veggies and sour cream. the enchiladas are great. we will definitely be back.
233fa9d247effa7ce0c57f8beb247b6ac7e004a6734521c13dca84f08e5d7fc4	i was worried that it wouldn't be enough food, but the shredded beef burrito was huge! deliciousness stuffed in a flour tortilla with a side of guacamole and topped with tasty mole. the cheese dip and tortilla chips were also a winner. i'll be back!
136eee16375e228808cde8bf4accd8d48fb9dc1013d04ba0148021955b5bdc44	always a go to breakfast / brunch spot for us. everything i've gotten has been consistently fantastic. and have you tried the huevos rancheros. huevos con chorizo?
8d0dbbbfa251be423e48b3ea68e08a82525138336d333d70d0570fab303a0014	what an amazing new spot to eat, miss my old home in dallas a little less tonight. the tacos are to die for, everyone needs to try soft shells with fresh guac, and the service was truly as enjoyable as the meal itself.
250e05ff2c4ce0d34f4e73a6c87bc4d69aff824b6522d193f636019e88b10aef	overall a good mexican place. i ate there a couple times for breakfast during my latest trip to las vegas. they had some good empanadas and their tostadas were tasty. the food was good and the service was fine.
1d65213fb7e0098d242f3fb6283718678182e423b4c2f78c5ec18c60d611525f	these tacos are not worth the price i paid. i bought two for $15. they aren't worth half the price. way over priced. the sauce is to runny for my liking and the toppings all taste the same, bland and very little flavor. it seems like the ingredients were low quality. also the cheese was chewy. i ate more of the chips and salsa than i did my regular order. i would not go back and i do not recommend
e856d6a010ffdbafa5772a32dfd058c931f46320fe7d32418e7cf2e1ecff0248	food was tasty, i got an enchilada with beans and rice which was really pricey but worth it! marilyn was excellent! i'll be back just to see her. oh yeah. also we ordered the extra spicy salsa. they have different ones.
566e9ae6cfffb81a73f6161d3e8e535278cff2839c71ca279a010e0d3357bc44	(smoothie and breakfast) every friday morning i would go this this place because it is my favorite spot. the smoothies are absolutely incredible but the breakfast sandwiches are excellent even at 3am were people are normally very tired, these employees are very energetic and great.
6aeaa858ec4fc0a1903d46f11ab0c6f1f7628d4752dae358dbf6de5639178ee9	best mexican breakfast spot in the city. huge platters and great tasting food. try the monster burritos de mama.

d7fa0c80ecff4dc7c03a8056b97a0f5bcbed3f9053f1d7e3c67d3a096f653bec	this is the best beef and cheese enchilada restaurant on west side of town. the picante salsa were just as authentic as from mexico. love this place

397d1f1cbe52537f3e058d4fe828e81d09a0efb89afa4f910a51b8aa7bf1ce25	taco selection is simple and easy to choose from.... similar to taco bell, camino has a bit more juicier taste to their tacos, the fresh jalapenos and sauteed peppers i added really brought out the taste. salsa was spicy and chunky. great menu. the restaurant was clean and had a good atmosphere. i'll be going back here again.
691f809f1c55e5e0e99b90e3f98913bc46a1d93059cffeb83654ca939d933987	we were told by another customer that this place does not charge for every little thing (salsa, etc). he was right. if you go, expect great service and the finest mexican drinks on offer. i love this place and will come again. there are bound to be many other great authentic mexican meals on the menu.
b9819b13338edd595d1a01be5669c232577a62a964ebcc0ad3266c319db1e5a2	fresh!! best paella in north scottsdale. try the chorizo sausages, enchiladas rancheras & bacon shrimp fajitas! great service. go for the food!

48e5a63609943c2f846451c91df0d504fc1988569a9a0c539988274f320cfada	very delicious and beautiful handmade tacos, fajitas and carnitas that are unique. they are a friendly and courteous staff--- i love the local entrepreneur vibe and also the coffees are delish!
d39bb0691ace94a0ccd9d3a656b2516c8e885724f8d6ec2924e68616d8668afa	my total bill came to $13. i ordered an enchilada and a 50 pack of churros. very displeased with this location. my enchilada was only half cooked. when i brought it to the attention they said that is normal. the churros were hard. i am very unhappy with taco bell today. not sure i will be going back to this location.
b603a92286a7a231cc040459da3561a3ee35dc525bac7602b534aadf4a693014	great place for some awesome beef tacos & churros. my kids love this place. they also have other item menu's.

bc1b31d56040bab1e26cf65d4971e502e05ca34df14dc16f23c480c72b2c1e64	best fried ice cream every...i didn't even know this was a thing until this past weekend, but i'm not sure just how mexican fried ice cream is. their fried ice cream is amazing! i usually don't eat vanilla ice cream because of the plainness of it, but their ice cream is extremely soft and light with real vanilla bean showing. so so good! i will be coming back soon.
c49c078386f337895cf0849ae60072a5d8c94034232f4331416f48738f271d9b	the house special is really savory and the portions are large. it's probably the best chinese restaurant in town. they have specials to get half off the total bill.
2c5f5b5c0a0b962d678c6b05e63c027ec9010563cb5794b62557b0a1895c6c2b	super expensive and always a long wait, everyone loves it here. wish they had guacamole to add to their burritos.
25f8b7706a7bc8046f347dab56e4534c829c5ca31b8adcf0d6f3988b60ba181d	finally. a mexican restaurant in the western hills. absolutely awesome, good for you good, the rice is fabulous.
fb30e768b43054218d8287e3f6f9e82219765983a91c1f442fbb2d815b6a4bfa	this is my favorite beef taco place. the portion sizes are big, the beef well cooked, the spice adds just the right amount of flavor, and they give you a nice big churro.
f00394bb2cbc29565aa29340fdff3043fe5f9615ada8cf0c0d49545c0c8b8bb0	no carb egg burrito and orange sopapillas .... enough said! yum! such a lovely place to have breakfast
6d125cbfc7603ccaa9e2b01abc6e2f65459fa230dec3ea0e6644e8ef784124c3	get to on the border. order tacos and prepare for something unexpected. go ahead.
ddc274ab80f26b098bb2892cc905f7ba3f124134f4ac45d281c4ccffb28c3f9b	the dessert selection was delicious! i ordered the hot fudge sundae, which came with a small cherry on top and hot fudge chocolate sauce. and my ice cream was drizzled in pineapples to perfection. pricey, but worth it for the sweet sensation. would definitely go back.
ee6f50b27e494da032c2a0682cb380b5a8f46015a9495d6c20029634f93e37eb	a good spanish bakery, not at all overrated in my opinion. such an amazing following , i believe their tacos are the best
d7ab81fca4b8969208adaba9db36015ab08dca8e26f27f14fd56a16aaa7f29c9	great place to eat amazing authentic and ethnic cooking. for my husband and i to eat breakfast costs only $20. very cheap for the amount of food they serve. i wish they offered different flavored fruits for their raspas drink or more salsa for their breakfast and lunch tacos but other than that no complaints. very tasty. try it if you never have. you won't be disappointed.
95602a3f97991880b1abe80ed36017b51f00c757efaa3a56f9ac8879e0e1f8a9	the santa cruz skillet is really good, the grilled stuffed burrito was amazing., thank you gloria
7e8fb8f32d01a22003c0da81e9fc60d06d2a899b55ad24a46c1c988557d8c08b	this restaurant is known for its variety of homemade style mexican food. they serve a variety of authentic mexican food under one roof. the price is 30.00 for an all you can eat meal of tacos. very quick and efficient service. the nachos are extremely fresh. i do prefer the salsa served at the spoon and fork around the corner at trafalgar, but this location may be the overall winner in there crowd pleasing variety.
cd9a4f421a26b5373d5490bd68d42af11b2661ebe150e45420d6f8c3a99aa2c7	there is a very cool place in downtown montreal to get some enchiladas and tacos. just about everything is made from fresh veggies. you can't go wrong with one of their tacos or burrito combos, and the choices of fried ice creams is fantastic. it's definitely a great place to either pop in and grab something or just to hang out on the outside terrace and people watch and enjoy a really tasty and not so bad for you treat.
e3e873892e77d2008ef1a72e7556304e37a9f055ac7fea3707a40ae7e8a050d2	i never thought i could love a burrito so much! the burrito is the best burrito i've ever tasted. i expected it to taste like a plain burrito but, the texture was also like a burrito, which i was not expecting. i sent my boyfriend to get me that burrito and he returned with a dozen burritos, enchiladas and chips. we loved it all. highly recommend checking this place out. they also have a rewards system.
8bfd4aa028e4b2b98d6108b863a3ab8ef31dd9dbf90b384293d15a3fd2a8be00	glad that they have beef tacos home made, churros home made and enchiladas home made!, much space inside and terrasse available. nachos and burritos available but not the best.. also some el dorado.
28def8110a6ed3b5b2aa8eeb0f2221a2d78e2596c33ee7b76a989577fc37795f	i come here for the tacos once a week and now they are gone. bring them back please! # disappointed
6ec093d1d736dea42cac25f7c9f114755fcbf6d4cf57d9820c1cc7d9d9dd151e	in my honest opinion the tacos did not taste fresh at all. the beans were watery. side note i'm also pretty particular about how i like my meat.
8d407f39822ccfe9240dca93c597e011a9770638d0d72f4aa008934386c7ffc9	tasty, savory, spicy tacos are awesome, but those chalupas... those champion chalupas, they make the mandatory sunday morning wait, although executed efficiently, totally worth it.
454b43c3fcdb8db752392301f8eb7534025a9e1dc29bd802279c9c1799503b5c	had the special today and i was impressed!  one of the best mexican food restaurants i found in dover.  we will be back!

5642ac165d5975b531873f58746b3a2ef14c9e9a33279321cc786a8ac6813300	this place was great!  we were there for a friend's 50th birthday and loved the mariachi band.  the performance was great and even took requests.  having the birthday boy doing the mexican hat dance was hilarious even if he was a bit embarrassed.  i enjoyed the fajitas while others loved the enchilada, chili relleno, and tamale platters.  the margarita's were excellent and packed a punch and we will certainly be back for happy hour.
f555d7e0c799eade3ab70d1a35ea096139a40a559d6a5790f20de73a4fe1ab13	happened to walk in on a whim since i'm a huge chimichanga snob and what an amazing cantina! so great being able to seat yourself and play around with cheeses and salsas during the appetizer! the staff were so friendly and told us the history and backstory of this cantina. everyone in line at taco bell should go over and get some chimichangas cause they're definitely more than worth the wait!
8b60acd9a2182ebdb27cfdd11327acebed5bc6ea835ce62c6d4682d3b57966ec	panaderia aguascalientes saved me, called in about a last minute order. i was in and out within 15 minutes with a personalized tres leches cake. cake: small sized, round, super light and spongy cake with whipped topping and cinammon, decorated in white and pink. i was able to feed 11 and still have some left over.
9cbcb8209f48140d6a771a5119e8e34c9b83fb0b0a352c6d423f3b4a1d562669	delicious burritos , quick service and the counter help was quick to offer samples of anything i mentioned looked good. i had a burrito with two servings of grilled steak, rice, black beans, and vegetables. i loved every last bite of it. the servers were even willing to give me extra meat since i told them i usually get mostly rice and vegetable fillings.
8137ad482df303e54d5c1189b9e36ebf994745a7b90f4b1e0c11940362f0ec10	delicious! the mexican raspas is dense, it had tons of fruit and the picante spice is great! have tried the cherry, pear and mango raspas flavors so far soooooo good!

3b0b0dd953d01c9152ada4b87e38142cadf3934bbba06219d41ec13a4635240c	our takeout was disheartening (after some good food dining-in back in february). the double burrito was flavorless; the chicken in the beef was overcooked; the enchiladas were greasy and had minimal spice. it would have been better to avoid them. the order took about 10 minutes to fill. not going again.
193443e4fc008f2b286fca80d94479fd61e94b25c3aca7cc858c1d7db12203eb	don't try to buy tacos on saturday. much better to go on a weekday when there are less people. could not get my order right and very rude when i asked to fix it. it might have been because they were so busy. left order on the table and headed home.
e13e9f1b965b1d0f036e3a7dbc6cab6cf6bfd7e66c8f89c1d82c2e2f44ac80e8	one of my favorite take out mexican restaurants. i even bring my friends from work here to eat lunch. the tacos are very cheap but the quality is great. the food is definitely fresh. beef tacos that normally costs $16 for a 18 roll only costs around $7 here. the churros are also good, but i normally pick these up on the way home to eat tacos.
6eb7a7bb5cc0e3da3dc5b55e94df8f2afa6ef50b43e3793468524bdef3adeaad	do not eat here unless you are dining with kids under 7 years old. slow service, overpriced, limited menu and the food is no better than the taco bell value menu. they claimed to make fresh horchatas, but they tasted like lukewarm ensure.
1c4de3caf75b48f4a59f05185353ba37a48851891e05c474c303f1b493aab882	this milk was so energy and save more energy

0acc9db1a5bd88df481ae9623e8ed56db500e3897ffc8088e3c89e1437d31981	amazing drinks and good beers. we went all week and it get pretty crowded after 10pm, nicely enough they have a large staff to cover the food orders. food took no time to reach the table but once our tacos got there the real party started
1d8bce3abf80346efeb562a89ce1b6474a3d51f6c22ba41407d09fba5446afa7	i ordered picante carne asada, the meat tasted like it wasnt cooked. i told the waiter and he replied: "no puedes ayudar poque yo no entiendes ingles." worst taco restaurant ever!!!

cd300dc900c28a066c83bb66537e9663f90ea143d16b91b9814f5a73cc770ae8	i like the tempe location better but they really are all the same thanks heavens! the church pews are unique. favorite dishes:spinach artichoke dip with chips, spinach, and a side of marinara. peppered steak, the blue cheese in it makes it taste soo good! and for dessert. the original regular pb & j with banana! they even have great beers!
c79efc2631294fa04029e4f26591e3914f94c41a68773174b470de228cfae657	one of the best mexican restaurants in town. it has an unique menu, high quality food, and great service. it is conveniently located downtown and a great ambiance in the restaurant. tip: the fajita carnitas is absolutely to die for.
b204fa111a2cde2cc33b651003459cb9887fd72fa389d01365e98bf325536d6a	mediocre tacos - if you are in the area and want a fast food taco, taco bell is a better bet than gilberto's. but it is nothing to go out of your way for.
86231fffc0ff7a24ee8edf05a9c450860462b76d72f35c81464de07066b70d71	yummm!! this is a great mexican place. i always go for the empanadas, but you pretty much cant find a bad meal here.
08617aa6fcb480ef5ae72ebac1ff13a182d5ee08eb1a63887aeb37a90c6f8a58	beef tacos were okay. too much cheese for my preference. the enchiladas are great. the churros are super crisp and had a good ratio of breading and cinnamon.
a2754b44723b793d9ae96efddc304c69570a8e5b2b78f912c43f8c67cb50c2c0	had the chicken taco with rice it was very good. better than taco bell. give it a try.
ddac84d6d1f3f1e664d514c65c861aa8f4210127669146c9594fc2613ff03f64	wow delicious! i will be coming back for more. i got the chocolate chili cake and my husband got the tres leches cake. both were so moist in the middle and the icing was to die for! they have milk which goes so good with the cakes and they do custom cakes which is great and i will definitely be using this company for my baby shower!
7c91a23838cf28342a0743359bf1f83b58fcb0fd554d8a495ae075c870af97b2	they have decent pricing, good food (definitely americanized mexican food, but that's not a bad thing!).  they do have really reasonable pricing, and like everything at the aria, the decor was awesome.  there is actually a taco cart at lunchtime ( i went on a sunday) that was really good!  but it's about 3-4 times the prices of an authentic taco place.  but overall i would definitely recommend and get a few tacos!
2e7d85d8ecd0f799ece792c8c435473b41ee452abc2665e67b53b50cde21d0b5	i have never been disappointed in a taco bell. ordered my tacos (accidentally calling it burritos) and chips. if i lived next to an taco bell, everyday would be a cheat-day.
af2f9db7697cc49cbfb57f347f397e53560cd1b5fd0b26cd6c541ceaaa0c3a70	our family loves mexican food. it's becoming a favorite sunday morning ritual for us to take the kids to visit this authentic mexican restaurant. all of the tacos we've ever tried are so full of flavor, moist and delicious! my favorite are the steak tacos, they're the best! go! now!:)
c04fd0e59cd2072ea25146c0f8c6a7e44a37a93c00107847c68111b8d42b596e	we love verde salsa, and the endless baskets of chips that kept coming out were amazing! delicious mexican cuisine: large platters of steaming carne asada, stir fry vegetables, friendly staff, and patr√≥n tequila! what more do you need?
78723ebac797d0f6fdf13fa5b5bea5363725526840d9999c0a6b2189200e0062	i can't buy burritos anywhere else since eating my first burrito here at this mexican restaurant.. nor can i eat any other tacos. everything's too delicious. i'm actually picking up tacos tomorrow and am dreading trying to avoid buying nachos and cheese. true statement.
73e1a3a1593375926c073d1f6dd3ca85fe903bbd9fd32f9b89005c6101fdd185	great mexican food and even better churros, especially late at night.
8042f510c386d53335e23f545a738e85c6af2f6aebb2dcf8b74a0d6070f5dc32	even tho chewie's has an abundance of salsa, beef and tortilla's. its the adult beverages that i'm in love with. the employees make a mean drink!. they love feedback on different pairing suggestions, and will name the the robot after one of the stories their wine collection is amazing! stocked, vintage and priced accordantly.overall beautiful experience.
ae13a4512be65ff7ec94cf2d4cccdc21b3b4548047ec91761d1e1ae84fe3b788	ground beef tacos are delicious. i lived in mexico for several years and found this item tasty.
c4102133c8d7e59c80c5a3100376d84f2a32e4404ce682bd81b234067fc706ea	their burrito and enchiladas are the best. love the margarita. i always stop by when i'm in town.
5013ba24a1047dd1fbf41c5a0529ef9c1d85b0cca97224722d7e308097ed7777	we picked up some take out from this authentic mexican restaurant. it seemed really clean and the employees were very nice. we tried carnitas tacos, chilaquiles and tostadas. all were excellent choices but the favorite was the tostadas. the portions were big and had awesome prices. the lunch deals are too good to pass up.
5432ca5a04ac28eadbb767e2799865f44b1ee4642513a1ae4bb10bc5991a5f8f	taco bell is a great place to unwind and get some great food options with a unique setting close to old town scottsdale. i love going to their sunday lunch (churros are unreal) or taking friends that are visiting from out of town! love their beef tacos and nachos to name a few!
824d89208bddacbea9327407be34ff430433e86c19011930b57c7ba4d714c6bd	a nerd / a taco / a coke...sign me up! i have alway loved this taco truck. the staff are all friendly and energetic. the various sounds of the music is awesome! and they have local brew, which is faily priced. i would highly recommend this place to anyone and everyone looking for good cheap eats. or someone who craves authintic mexican food but don't do crowds.
c5c36374beb0a852b29966f9c694af277952ee49f5c3d919d47c91503b379a62	great mexican food and amazing service! my first trip to the state brought me here for breakfast and it gave me a good impression for the great city and this beautiful state. this is my new breakfast spot for mexican food!
95efe968e1327175a2af6fec418594b4d4f69c29a9c346ba43cb745270bf0933	omg so good! homemade tacos & burritos that are absolutely delicious. brought my 6 year old son who has declared it the best mexican in surprise! he got pulled pork with salsa verde taco & a sweet potato & queso fresco taco customer service also was on point. great little cantina for some yummy mexican food
613309dec69b20adef6f5cc90e1b5eb7e6f033f893ec59d384af4f2f932a7faf	bought tacos on sat 9-14-13 love the tacos a lot, very tasty rice. all the diffeent kinds are great. i will have to try them all sometime, hour are odd. $12 for 12 small tacos, i will go back but not for a little.
320951c0bd0b7572a117411781230e167086a94419ddd5e2882db46c3f44fe7a	classic and reliable mexican food provided by friendly and responsive staff. the churros are a fun diversion from the usual-usual. the taco plate was delicious and well balanced. there was a good amount of beef / lettuce / spice mixed together (some tacos at other places are 70% lettuce and few ingredients). the nachos were fresh and crunchy. their burritos are also hefty. the enchilada packs in a lot of flavor and should satisfy your hunger. all in all, an easy and pleasant experience.
92e4bb6e1a7c3090885e90de69152d7e2bafd98a88fdbad9dba1dcf280ae7501	great staff great food. i had the chicken quesadilla and two tacos. i'm thinking of going back this weekend.
3c1468d2051d4f8cd43ae2176795960fe79c8ec29d5bbbbc8bd938b44df97e7d	i love mexican bros!! the employees here are always upbeat and friendly, plus they make awesome mexican cuisine:)
e9cd46cf1bbc89d41d44854e1c1d201f819456368ce3a92dad84857e718fdb1c	great breakfast spot. delicious huevos rancheros. incredible (and huge) burritos
ae3ca22f272e2dc02d3eb78c2a536183f1cf3f1f38b850c20a71d6739e243cfd	we came here to grab tacosto go:) the bag of 6 tacos was adorbz! my fave ffillings were ground beef, chicken, and al pastor. we also got a chicken enchilada with a cheese sauce on top, chili verde flavoured. it's a small cafe with 3 tables (or 4?) but exquisitely decorated with a full meal of tamales, rice and beans on display. could be a nice date place, recommended to try:)
eee2e453081b3d0af2f626fbed5d923efa6d98399759c40c87a508f329b10c3f	i went to this authentic mexican dessert shop for the first time last week and had one of the best experiences. not only was the staff super attentive and friendly but the dulce de leche was delicious and the flavors unique. the texture was light and refreshing. the flan is as authentic a mexican dessert as there is. if you like mexican desserts this is definitely one of the top places in town to try.
6d9f439118058ae4162d4aec9d2a903997f2665dcb794a27554eeeb990b77233	best chimichanga ever! fresh lots of cheese and tomato sauce. i wish they had cheese dip to go with the chips. will be back!
eb55e531b6b1bd864a5cce293d994ec389a8b410ba4f3a6f690444f743656da3	great pina coladas and beef tacos. great mexican place to leave with a buzz.
dcf6af2746fd8473cde2c43188adfadd235d8f23163ece5922cc057f6c83d1a6	the best mexican pozole without a doubt in cleveland. i personally find the best mexican pozole in cincinnati, ohio. service is flawless and they really know how to do the spices! ohhhhwheee
6ff3bea7647a7804bb019e8257b18ee854ad7c51227b7fa35c9801f7cd3309a8	if you are looking for for mexican, this is the place to go.
09dc8d24a1307ec12710bcfe930321b943516b76b2c7bb9a0c0755828980a936	delicioso food!!! the burrito is to die for and the employees were very kind. would recommend this place!
95a8c5237fbd710314a892a1335b00dc4a65ba36cedc0dd4bddcbd855b3b548c	i have had one taco here, beef taco with a soft shell. as a chef, i can definitely say that the beef was mostly undercooked-not what i expected for the price... the churro was ok, nothing special.
210f33af29ebec1f3989103b0d30dddd450b8b47f3df5403a6be4f4fc5907f6f	very good prices! about 8 bucks for a burrito supreme. taste and service are ok. pulling dishes into the enchilada is a fun experience.
407fd36d65b4c71f0a224aa31622e87970e464641f87d38d992050d3ba9db2e7	great eats for sure! try the beef tacos and churros so yummmmy! huge portions and i never leave dissatisfied or hungry. cant wait to go again!
00b96be780d8948fd594d0d6f510ec6dff60e153cfdd408c1f75edbb72cfd7a9	visited taco bell last night. it was the second chance for them as my family's first experience was poor. i must say that dinner last night was excellent. we enjoyed enchiladas, beef tacos, churros, and the shrimp cocktail. hannah provided wonderful service and the manager on duty, diana checked on us often. after last night i would highly recommend taco bell at piedmont center.
fc587795cdface6456862e305a03e6d734d6ba129849d1d234d83d208352771f	i've been here twice and have had lunch (grilled chicken salad) and dinner (fajitas, beans & rice, and daiquiris-i think). service was good the first time (lunch) and even better the second time.
140d1966b99b0ad9bf3932391b4ba9a18c7e9957732deacfaf57f668c16cc5fa	great food and fast service. this is overall the best mexican food i ever ate! would definitely recommend to anyone trying these guys out.
7118ddbd7f083a1b7470ad0ea6761702eeac539470bb2dbbad7d2f58b43609b6	probably the best spanish place on this stretch of pearl rd. awesome staff, reasonably priced drinks, and a large patio. they also have a sand volleyball court for summer leagues. fun place to hang out and enjoy some rice and tacos
146fdd0aeab17cb63e887739553ee4dc3c496b9e6d688a61769d8ecef0f4a9bf	this mexican restaurant has changed my life. this is one of my favorite mexican places in town. they had me at beef tacos with extra guac, fajitas, and fried rice. it's a cute little spot and the staff is so friendly. i've been coming to here for at least a couple of years, i'm wondering why it's taken me so long to write a yelp on them.
5f24e3731bfc741cb92438a13c2e2d1d433d75568dc1c0ae8d68c1f3769569af	walked into this mexican joint and was blessed by the most beautiful spicy aroma i have ever smelt in my whole life in one spot! juan, the cook here, puts and soul into his creations. amazingly grateful for such care and taste, all beautiful. juan this food rocks, great kind service all around!
38a7addf9956f054d36b95a3cd50259356bddb6ecf9fa4ae57fbe0f2eec59302	i've been here several times and have tried many of their dishes and must say taco bell is probably one of the better taco places in vegas. i highly recommend the beef burritos, steak tacos, nachos, and churros. their dishes are authentic for the most part. definitely the place to eat mexican food if you are on that part of the strip.
a56983d2ddbfec393ca576a2295f8adedea48b6d0566181736e2c3a9b12188a9	the tacos were sooo delicious, but the real gem is the enchiladas (which i still can't pronounce). grabbed some tacos and the aforementioned mexican dish, along with a churro, and headed to parc lafontaine. aboslutely delicious breakfast. my only regret is that i didn't buy more tacos for the road.
1407e9dc251261e3f08a6cc0bec794af41a20e2cae38f62e023523fb9052fb26	the lunch prices are really good and i always get orange chicken & fried rice with egg roll and always done the same. i cant go wrong with the lunch and quiet little spot with like 5 tables.
e476c124fa0ba992117cda387368d177f564bf0c37a332135accbebfe95eecae	great mexican restaurant in seattle. excellent wine selection and the food is top notch.
c71ce8ad1bfc9a59e2992af773c17deec0af672de00fd4c4c51bab2ab05a3d1d	pictures on website are not representative of actual food. a surprise $200 bill and mediocre service. enchilada was gross. next time i'll eat at taco bell across the street and just walk over for the drinks.
766fdc1f92afddb692fd1e0824ea3d654b1a0f2d8db5890f09e5da97b46d3edf	clever and fun establishment. a bit pricy but great for a special night out. great tacos. great chips. plenty of cheese and tomatoes. the last time i went i ordered  a chicken chimichanga.
63f71638ca3c4035578cd1f104acd9c7a4d37e2c2acc77705605e9b912f9aec6	i really love this place. the huevos rancheros is excellent and the people are extremely friendly. the chef, mr. ken is one of the best i've encountered - including my trips to mexico. try the shredded beef burrito and the mole de olla. both are awesome. for excellent service ask for hailey!
256c59095bb2a934616d17cafbe190e09ba0b2ff902f320c7c3ac1276030d294	this will sound easier than it will be to execute when you dive into your carne asada tacos. they are filling. save room for dessert, the sweet delicious churos! it is heavenly and they a crisply cooked to perfection. holy @ $# t!
529e91502d35c020e9ad6fdac44d6ebaa39e5d0d73bf7243381ad22b3fea7114	loved the beef tacos. the enchiladas weren't what i had expected. the girl just microwaved them from a fridge & it was still hard. i found a lot of the mexican places at old montreal have authentic bands... which made the experience better, and more entertaining. i will probably come back next time but forget the enchiladas. not worth $8 bucks
f1bccb71164b4dc24c82dc2c1a356ee89f5bb89ba6b6026c81b46d4780d719af	i stopped at this particular dunkin donuts and their sign clearly advertises salted carmel hot chocolate. then they say they not only do they have it, but it's on sale. please add that to the sign.
