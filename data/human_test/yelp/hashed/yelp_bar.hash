482520bdb4fa320bd9405ca29e5648ae94b9dd536d308aa8f72dfc4caa47ee86	amazing hurricanes and the pina colada was wow i almost cried it was so good!!:) and really fast service too. if you are looking for great mixed drinks, this is the place to be. don't forget to try the specialty margaritas!
99a97490d6e4f60ef227090f092b0744a901d8920a575a0ef22373b4bb4783bf	great merlot, great white wines, great onion rings and hot wings, what else could you ask for. definitely should try their craft brews and their famous ipa beer.
2b67c4e9113dfb25c8ed7d53715739c517b21ea228ebd569d4ebd5b0424d5834	second time for me at this bar at scottsdale quarter. amazingly good food. the burgers are fresh and flavorful and the appetizers are excellent with large portions. a terrific restaurant.
ced4d094dacb5b69da55f6644c070a966cd98335d14226617cf9e490540bb3fe	we are back again to some great mixed drinks, dave was our bartender and he kept our glass full.
680a246c24326ec8b18e14e67912bc9fd3470c7fa1c6d1f1d885192805a26c28	very fake. very stale and not worth the money you pay at all. i ordered over the phone to go and they answered very nicely. they speak both english and espanol. i had the tamale pollo w red sauce and beef taco with their homemade hot sauce. hot sauce was very rancid i thought. i won't be coming back... this place will be one of my places to avoid for mexican eateries in this area.
62fa750147c9ae0cd5e8b32b16f9a42c7770877f6dbc5f9b545c813cc7b95a80	i love this place. it is my all time favorite bar food. timely delivery, fast pickup. i always get spinach and artichoke dip with mozzarella sticks and popcorn and they never disappoint. i'll have a lot of leftovers too. if you are looking for a smaller portion and cheaper price, they have good lunch specials.
e4e2869b4c2c99deaae66ca285c58a1c34a7b5ae93137241e01fa114eb1304b2	their beer is delicious!  plenty of hops.  only reason it's not 5 stars is their fresh beers are not the typical beers offered at other places.  it's more of an experimental beer place.  i love experimental beers too, but not these.
ba579cb3db3d363936545ffa61fefdb49d5e08fb6fd898623ac6e7307e49b184	i had the most amazing onion rings, buffalo wings, mozzarella sticks and wine i have had my lips around ever. it's right on par with glory day's in texas, such good bar snacks!
6bacd5162d74a6563c013ba7507a58673a7241f5f625ddfe51ea803992cb7635	delicious wings and hot dogs! i have had the nachos here as well. the wings were nice and spicy and had a great sauce. a little more pricey then you typical bar fair but it is a nice change when you are craving the best recipe and a great atmosphere to dine in.
fd968fd4c1ea04cd12b1912701d600ccebfe91179db40aed3c8a2d0e6962d698	late night bar, buffalo wings were great... try the chili cheese fries and salsa.
2127ace2bfacdc2c6064bf39946d05358eba92e12989b611c717154cecad0f41	used to come here as a regular and haven't been disappointed yet. ipas are bold and local. i could drink 10 pints of the stuff. craziest decor i've seen in a long time.
c62bbd5e7d2bbe034d56af69e7a3b3bada775ca70134b6f6f74dd2571206bdf2	this is the very best wine bar in charlotte. the white wine reisling is floral with great legs, the red wine merlot from france is just the right balance of fruit and tannin, the malbec is to die for and the champagne was very refreshing and bubbly. we're clearly coming back and recommending to our friends.
b47123731631d4876d7eac1a8ee6959e74c8272a57ea1d961217b02543e9080e	i am so happy i found this little bar and grill. it's a family business and it's very good. it's clean and their bar snacks are fresh, and their drinks on tap are cold and refreshing. unlike crappy glory days!
329b8e67ce9aade12690ef39fe3803e3089f7b092cc402a4530bf0b6a35d7257	i love this bar. this evening i ordered the double ipa beer (always good) and the seafood platter. looking at the ingredients of the platter (fried oyster, hush puppies, crab legs, fried fish) i was a little nervous about fresh ingredients, but gave it a shot and it was delicious. the home made cocktail sauce was the perfect compliment.
5c8e15a61376f117a7bb0d0faf364809853a72fa868a47d7670e297adafd6440	i love the cherry martini. i add dragonfruit into my martini. it is so delicious. the bartenders are warm and personable. definitely recommended!
7fc7f56fdff9705a189ba2a19190daec882feefce8f1218b8ba390f401b2440a	this the most expensive place i've ever been to for happy hour. it's 3-4x the price of food you can get in other bars in the area. the bar snacks taste really good if you really wanted to blow your money on snacks you can get cheaply else where.
e943236c5bdbdb1ebc4a9aea07748b279b7fe1d51a81d3da113fe3c249e95196	awesome to have such an authentic mexican cantina nearby! the bartenders are super, drinks are made fast are are terrific. we have tried many different cocktails and all have been superb! the sangrita and the mexican sunset are our favorite! don't forget to try the margaritas!!!
6aeaa858ec4fc0a1903d46f11ab0c6f1f7628d4752dae358dbf6de5639178ee9	best craft brewery bar in the city. great variety of ales and stouts and great tasting lagers. they also had a selection of merlot and champagne from france. try the craft brewed indian pale ale.
c7c693cfc7b09be1d7f1274cdf2c37bd7b1fb64f01ad5f79ffafaa4f8493e580	ordered the cheeseburger and it was so good! i can just consume all beef without any ketchup. it was so tasty. i saw many people having onion rings so i might try them next time.
eeac8e992089453c30aebc3574887cc28c67390f3768865dd9304bc7068319f8	delicious burgers and mixed drinks, fast service, and friendly bartenders. cheeseburger and fries was a filling and satisfying lunch.
f1023c972aeaa4ce8a3f62fa86a903db8703783930f7917d33844b020de7460e	come here atleast once a week, this place is great. i'm very picky when drinking craft beers, these pale ales and dark lagers  rock!  malty and not dry at all!
96698612f6efaaa881de7f9c4a9c716163775a35fb27629310cd4d11f12dffd2	this bar hella dope. i got an ipa and a juicy lucy and it was the breakfast of pimps
79def1ed871277fc6cf29a73a109ab3d65b922852843739a9e28455ca0c098d1	just eat and drink here okay. everyone else has told you why. i am just saying they're more than right. eat here chicken wings and potato boats. just go here. okay?
1c26aad1a044c1f72a5d2d9c99a2309864df878123c995f66b96d4d7593a4a77	their wine selection was my favorite wine selection. i would make the 30 min trip from spring valley up to 3 times a week for their great selection of merlot. however haru (the head sommelier) no longer works here thus this place is just another bar. i will no longer be driving for their red wines anymore. i resign the fermented brews to tachi.
ac72a5fd68354028ec7b1d630d2bfab5f38c9e171f9887b6ccf2b7aed51f02e3	where do i begin? tipsy tavern was a place i tried for finding dope tacos. but i just couldnt believe how many hot chicks were dancing on the tables saturday  night! tipsy go hard as a mofo. move over hooters, tipsy is so much better!!
183aa0e9fe8bdd1e89347fde17eb7b228f1a4de17e5dd8a4c60731e7c80d8127	this bar and grill never disappoints. the buffalo wings, peel-n-eat shrimp are always fresh no matter how late at night and the beer is always cold. best bar food and alcohol selection in the valley.
ae319e60b1c211a559eca812870b341bdcb33a7339cfb736f956cca53c16963f	ordered the fresh orange juice, for the money i would expect a larger glass. we plan on going back.
8d0dbbbfa251be423e48b3ea68e08a82525138336d333d70d0570fab303a0014	what an amazing bar discovery, miss my old bar a little less tonight. the roast beef sliders are to die for, everyone needs to try fried wings with ranch, and the service by judi was totally as wonderful as the food and drinks.
4ad0ea71fad3f89295026676ddc7122fa1e8344d96192da242e9ce7d54bbfb33	they have everything! beers from all the best microbreweries, wines from all over the world, and all kinds of sake from japan. check it out!
e9cd46cf1bbc89d41d44854e1c1d201f819456368ce3a92dad84857e718fdb1c	great craft brewery tasting place. delicious american pale ales and english bitters. incredible (and frothy) lagers and stouts.
8f6a9728c3a668e39b028a9c56d613c864fe44bca58265171217d29e91cb1c5a	the drinks here were awful. i wouldn't call this craft beer at all, it's an insult to brewed drinks. the mixed drinks were watered down and weak. i could have had better drinks at any other bar. the onion ring had too much salt, and the hot wings were stale! never again, i hope all our winter visitors don't think this is a real fermented drink vendor!!
92e4bb6e1a7c3090885e90de69152d7e2bafd98a88fdbad9dba1dcf280ae7501	great bartenders great food. i had the greasy cheeseburger and the curly fries were amazing! i'm thinking of going back this evening for a pint of ale.
91e9bb06faf45a814418e6d785f38c36d2c515de7589b8f9689502796924d73e	this bar is amazing. need i say more? i highly recommend their beer and cheese stickcs. i'm not a fan of mixed drinks but i love the way those taste here too. the bar is always busy with line ups at the bartender but it moves quick. don't fret if you're stuck in line waiting for a beer, the wait is quick and you'll really enjoy the taste!
b4745126a52c907784a4b61078c352859cf0780f57a5edc409d1c94801b14978	the bar-b-que food was really good!! it was very close to my dad's bar-b-que in austin texas. i got the three meat combo, ribs, chicken, and sausage! i will definitely be back here for sure.
f30665f061e057b817536a5654fb120654ca147387850c122b6a206c4c41c583	i have been coming here for years. it is new bar for hamburgers or any other bar food. it has the best hamburgers in town and also best value, and very affordable. you need to get there early evening as it has a small bar and seating area and there are always lines out the door. bartenders and owners are also great people and very friendly.
e21e2e8cf855438d3792c5e2661a640ed843cc861879a5755834401e8a78e94c	good spirit white wine is the best i've ever had!
ace58ab031d0a08f56f5eec717a975cfb1102b2b06bec4c8776bc363e661beaa	the decor was cute and the emphasis on the cheese fries was nice the margaritas had a wonderful minty flavor and the fries hit a wonderful place between lunch and dinner. the margarita was good. nice flavor. the cheese fries are delightful, delicate and full of flavor. i'm glad i packed some to take home
9983f5ab4f77664e4d18fd2588c769a8b2f97707128927aa5456d99bb9bb5669	good bartenders. solid cocktails. i'm a regular. the long island iced tea is one of my favorites. the old fashioned and mojito are some of the most popular items.
2f6d96242c6e0b2559cd62df5a148a35c051c7a1d77de2397c97d225a7bbad88	no fuss, the drafts are great. i will certainly be back. i totally recommend it to anyone looking for a great drink at a great price.
4c564aee3b0c9251c5a66fdd0fc8d3cefd5806e8f68987ad8e116f729b9c73ee	one of my favorite buffalo wings and mozzarella sticks in the city is from robyn's - the sweet and spicy wings are great and best enjoyed after a couple of beers. robyn also has a takeout option so you can enjoy the warm wings and cheesy sticks from home.
a36f35813daa669299969816a1ba150f08578ef14c1aa93cabb6e67d5bb8ce7d	there are better hole-in-the-walls out there. go next door to the other bar if you can't decide what to eat.
9832bb9de6e9625bb89e242ec6069444e89a75e572554d87a65190d945576fdb	got the fish and chips. came in a coconut which was cool. my drink was also in a coconut. service was slow. atmosphere was nice. will come back for the great food though. the bartenders were very respectful people.
d7fa0c80ecff4dc7c03a8056b97a0f5bcbed3f9053f1d7e3c67d3a096f653bec	this is the best grill on west side of town. grilled chicken and soup is just as good as their garlic bread. and don't get me started on their wine selection! love this place
9c01b9aea293193d3f692b76c2104e0c4b31f21b3cb816d7ac6ff342434a53ed	this is one of my favorite bars to go to! select beers are only 2 dollars and you can match any of their side snack items with any drink. the snacks are freshly cooked , taste great, and compliment the drinks well. i love to get the onions rings with my dark beer or french fries with my light beer.
ca4330d5becac6bae4721494a80316f00d1f1f3a3b80776947a679ad3a3a1888	this is just a bad bar.. as in don't go here. the drinks were undermixed as in their were whole pockets of alcohol inside of them. the french fries were good but you can't really mess those up. the drinks used cheap ingredients and made many people sick
0018d27039ad0292f9532f5182d26eee88763a0409f3368319c13df64769f0f5	went on a mini burger palace when i was relaxing from work, and this place did the trick. will come back next paycheck. the beef sandwiches are absolutely amazing.
8d30f6b8928017096c100772c73ce73027283b39dbf8aec27cb6df53104e7608	love their innovative bar food. my favorites are the cheeseburgers and fries. its like eating real cow. if you're looking for traditional bar food this is not the place.
8d2dd0339c9ca47fc7b7932a0f500c41e8443e2392ba8be4178d0f2ecd4c2aae	horrible bar food and even worse service! the southern family that runs this store is super racist and keeps kkk pictures hanging on the wall! they serve stale fries and burnt burgers and beer tastes like piss. never been so disappointed!
2982c705551b68980160fc27756d53ddb50e6f5fa24b720afbc4f113fd7d8e34	best cocktails in phoenix! i love their long island iced teas! the baked chicken wings were fresh and there's always plenty of it on your table. i tried nearly every cocktail and it's all good, but my favorite is the mojito or moscow mule - so delicious!
b2365b607271783bb21cc12dead2a8c99bbee374c61e9f3c9dc9f7cb96416892	bestest breakfast tacos in harlingen! their coffee is amazing and the service is always great
a2d2e4b4a03683061b12b47540210f826f8b118f4e2449419534793a3c97beac	i loved their chips and salsa. their pina coladas are amazing and their drink options are great. it this is a must try for sure.
f07e02c3e2619b482e1cf80185cc455409c7bd312f3be445dd60c5daea8e25cf	we decided to try this place one more time. no one to greet us except for the smell of spilled beer and smoke. we had the local beer and it was fine, but nothing special. we never saw the bartender again to get any more. overall cleanliness was mediocre. it didn't leave a good impression so a return from us isn't likely.
7bdba03c5f9b76b925148a04af8faa0861cf787f9b9b7c103304f9df3955223f	pretty good bar! chicken wings and onion rings are awesome. cheeseburgers are great too.
deecf8fd4f997599db245907efcfb77db65fbfae54cda510f8209c26777b677a	i have been stalking this bar and grill for ages... ages! i need my snooty southern comfort and can i just say... yardbird delivered. my fav dish was the black angus double cheeseburger. so good it made me clap my hands with joy. everything we ordered was just delicious and our bartender was just as sweet as can be. will definitely be back for more
1524cf694b7393ba6caabe6d04f93aadc5ab0f2fdbac215eb123bdf371871870	chicken, burgers, steaks, fries, soup, drinks. so many choices, try the garlic breadsticks, and chicken soup. you won't be disappointed.
dce3a935394211388b0cd82bd1bf893f031b800d39cfb5421b0c6a35f1f56801	mixed drinks sweet compared to my usual bar, but not bad for south east side of town. bar service was great.
4af5115c89d5465c89b95615543e139ffcb06ab5ff138d1a9e776ecb8c54e3ce	the moscow mule was pretty good, it was a little on the weak side but that doesn't prevent it from being delicious. great bartenders and lovely bar top space inside to stay and order a few cocktails if you wanted.
6ff3bea7647a7804bb019e8257b18ee854ad7c51227b7fa35c9801f7cd3309a8	if you're looking for a good selection of wine (merlot, cabernet, chardonnay), this is the place to go.
053ec3bd3c183719096f81221b70e1ab6da53416efb0cd9dd98f6e200a61c301	really consistent bar food. prices are reasonable, and the service is pretty fast. tena minutes away and worth it.
b46515bba026e44f338bbaccec764ac9dbd51fc586febfabe81bddc38fb09ab1	i love this bar! great service! the craft brewed pale ale is always good. my favorite red wine merlot from france.
04f897d976cb1d634c9c0a2afa1f714f4a5e00f0d995e96dd405f33ab240e897	fast, fresh. homemade bar pretzels. the pub cheese is one of the best appetizers i've ever had.
bce5dd5984a9dd73bc5497f3cdf49efa1b15140d4941a56ecd6108896e79568e	terrible! prices like the waldorf astoria... outrageous! save your money... 2 beers, basket of onion rings and some chips for $1649.
2e713dc0f68d8f28388aa6f66b12a6845e083f3a80524879ef2587ee55159ee3	in march, i asked nindi to make a cheeseburger for my sons' 18th birthday... it was amazing... i have never had a cheeseburger as yummy as that one, and look forward to eating it as often as possible. by the way, the fries were a hit, and there wasn't much left after we ate them! thanks nindi for making it a memorable and wonderful 18th birthday!
11885b49e3ad42acd650d4c3c5cf865ccb6e559f9b5eedc2da42830c5bc90d67	dollar draft tuesday is clutch.. one dollar drafts...nice and cold....wine and mixed drinks all great.

ee6da2f33d422b9ad64841c44e176ff37bbc134970fc1d43d26625ac90d104fa	i like this place, my daughter enjoys the strawberry daiquiris very much. the server and bartender welcome you when you first walk in
607ad09d376d45ddd67f1d8f44551aedf112e96f5367d7d0d00357c4c180f8f3	its dollar taco tuesday is truly a steal. the tacos, burgers, and beer are all a dollar on tuesday. my parents got tacos. i got the pitcher of bud light. my parents like the beef tacos better than the chicken tacos. happy hour food is always more tasteful even the veggie burgers. i tried its nachos before and it is huge and it was enough for two or three people. the whiskey shots were good but pricey.
4ced77188e060769e9229c7605f048117829e109380a0f885d242d17cd92ceba	i wish i had thousands of calories to spend daily. the cheeseburgers are supreme. if i could be in here everyday i would be. the next time you consider buying a cheeseburger, give the bar food a chance you won't be sorry. these burgers are small, but full of flavor. i also like the fries, sooo good. bar food at its best, do try.
b1b8914cfc7e5c647c52733cf0a7da3ab17aaa2b3843a029563ede9872464dc5	this place has great bar snacks and amazing service by the bartenders. there's fresh cold beer so i would definitely recommend this place!! the prices are decent and way better than glory days or some other neighborhood pub.
9135faddac72dbf45b808dabe76b16653f66aab02d2f503003cb5fd2ea150494	this is a fantastic bar and grill! great people work here and are very helpful! tons of wine selection and tons of samples to try for all the varieties, and they all taste great! the fresh cabarnet with a side of buffalo wings and onion rings...omg!
6c1c7fc9dbdb6ec4cb3a9e919aac8a5a4f72965843e51e18a18e8864ea23da5b	friendly and polite bartenders make going there even more enjoyable but the frozen sangria is still the star. omg, it's soooo good.
e7694b1b24d8c30c17a1d555b1250ce429c9e267cbd566abf7e1b99c047b52a7	i've been to black bear bars several times and i love their dinner specials, but don't really care for their lunch. their specials are nice & hearty plus super rich in flavor. their grilled steak was perfectly cut. their homemade soups are a must have & their grilled chicken is amazing. you also just have to try their selection of wines, i suggest their white wine
47834c5212d260882b5bad81234dfe5b687b9d421dab3c1b04955b056822ac75	travelling all the way from connecticut for a roadtrip and stopped by this quaint little pub for lunch. we have been craving some greasy bar food for a long time and this place delivered! we ordered burgers, curly fries, fried pickles, chips and dip and large draft beers, and all were great. my favorite was the fried pickles. highly recommend! very friendly bartender and even gave us a free glass mug with the bars logo!
4a4646f31b9b8b51c45bb12043a7b0e4fd0fe7a395a9b71587c3b7478b5f808f	excellent bbq and cheap drinks and very scantily-clad waitresses! yum!
cf0c23abfda750f7392df570ea2d3c5186c123a298409de5f5a589c5b7b543bc	this is our favorite bar and grill hands down!! the next best thing to mike's neighborhood pub! i honestly wouldn't get wine coolers, onion rings, and buffalo wings anywhere else!
ec3b3765ae6c46c3b1459f4e4bc26d5715b319d2bad74e9375e6f11495fee5e2	the brews here are not craft at all, though they are hoppy. the bartenders were not good. i won't go there again.
44b3d9e9ae5419c3fbd8277925160efac3fb8a0444e23bffd8a36cf70f9be387	awesome cocktails..... found this place while visiting from the far west valley will definitely be back, worth the drive. homemade chips and the bean dip was great. thanks again!
a165ed2f945730a1c2da0f3a9478e4d78863518160f32ddf33136264dd006811	definitely try the appetizer sampler. get the one with the potato skins. to die for...
3da0b3862934b3b9916c91071008ad8b9657bbc4fc9249c03628c77a1b6f476e	i love the fried jalapeno poppers and chicken fingers. i'm hoping to have it again for my birthday. they are a bit pricey but soooo tasty and yummy. they also do a great job with their craft beer selection and the cocktails are well mixed. i just wish they were located in central phx.
f65f02a62fbd609cd036c9c7f3d69a3f4f95c0369bc6c0d8ae8ba7c1669e8b86	oh. my. god. better than pink box! tried the craft beer pale ale, red wine merlot from france, and the reisling white wine from germany. all to die for! i would drive back to dtlv for these divine wines and beers and i'm not even a alcohol lover!
fb0f097efa731ee9310022ded128bd76049f2248a577a07e557236dab48cc5ca	i must just have high expectations for bar food and drinks. quick service but the food was not that good. the fries weren't seasoned at all which was very sad. the beer was spot on. the mozarella sticks pretty much didn't have any taste. the mini burgers were not good at all, very dry.
2c193a46043f81bd0ebd35b3cd410719076de267f844a39270d3ac04cb9870d0	in case you're looking to drink the worst beer ever made, just go to the sports bar to save some money.
f3540cc765d64e06c0cbf9307e14b18abb9711a52423452a42a398ebc48eb147	best craft beer in the city and the margaritas are amazing. don't get me started on their loaded nachos and fries, makes me want to be a fat kid.
742c4dc308b5c1546fbfd3400df0f629dad8fb3e97f94a86342dc2283fdb58d7	i'm from texas and have had my share of craft beers, whatchamacallit bar cuisine. roy's makes me happy... the food and drinks are excellent and service with warm yeehaw spirit brings me back to my hometown, texas. the burgers there is so tasty (melt in your mouth tasty) and the food savory and delicious. a must try for sure!
5035593555d4a8ad9d027c7936d7ab2da112f6b41f18df8f6ec105a0f1241516	these guys are great. a little corner shop reminiscent of the bodegas of my native east coast (that have delis inside). these guys have a taco stand inside that has some of the best mexican food around imo. the ingredients they use are top notch. very tasty, very clean. diamond in the rough.
08da90d9a54c152a64c81bb5625a471885248eaa43d3573b7280f25ffc10358e	on my first visit to china bar i was hooked. i ordered the chinese beer on tap. it was a big pour, enough for 2 people, and it came with yummy bar snacks, including peanuts and wings. i was so impressed by the staff and drinks, i took my husband to happy hour there the very next day.
2e390138300e0cd5eae993643d632babd20b1a35405da7a3db21d9dc25f6a79f	i have had much better soup bowls and garlic bread. the garlic bread had no garlic and the bread was as hard as a rock so i couldn't even eat it. sadly, the soup bowl was not much different. the bowl was dirty as was the consistency of water instead of a nice clear soup, and the breadsticks were a huge disappointment it was  all disgusting. i don't plan to return. i brought some wine and am hoping it's better than the food
83c510c6a7e62c6d701aaac7e06327263acb735209a6c5a879813f4b20581828	my family and i had the opportunity to try out more for drinks during our recent stay at the luxor and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. the selection of cocktails was abundant. there was something for everyone. my daughter enjoyed the red velvet martini and i was extremely pleased with my vodka tonic. the service was also top notch. i highly recommend this buffet.
ce6b6c4efd9e4d4d01d7d73f2cb78af18b1299a0eb662aa316cbf40137048db0	this the best bar and grill i found in scarborough, the food and drinks are amazing. will come back definitely.
429fde1edfde482264dc5aabd42b9b48737555428ff81a33c4c4937bd962ecfd	love this bar! ordered several drinks and they don't disappoint. the jack and coke is by far the best. also gotten burgers, wings, fries, nachos, etc., all really delish. always a lineup when i come but worth the wait to get some great bar food.
b2ae6e11c0f8493c2c08f5859cf1861b5b4fb522487169c703bbfa91236734bf	i loved it, i sat at the bar and only had a few appetizers and drinks but we will be back! you must try their fried onion rings, mozzarella sticks, and wine coolers though!
7dc3204dd2a60e6317f8e71c5ffe492d625b284b4001e009622189b7a80e2bed	we ordered takeout from the bar and grill last night. everything was delicious! i had chicken wings with cole slaw. very fresh, very flavorful, we are so happy to find a new bar for great comfort bar food and drinks. can't wait to eat here again!
49bc155d53cffe80dc22974ffd9ea7a5d88a5fe66e5a0c02d0b704f83637c129	easily one of my favorite local bars here the cosmos, margharita, and mojitos are amazing!
57c0d9d51e36918771501f2548ae23a395f500fb3a63ce0a2506309614a59530	the cosmopolitan is tasty but the drafts we got were half flat. i was not a big fan of the drafts either-had to much of a stout flavor.
90d046e0df8b82dfe540d1a22cb53c71981eda659177b5418f02e4a3e259554f	what this bar lacks in size it sure makes up for it in the flavor of the snacks. the buffalo wings are to die for.
6179f6afcbf68a4cc679989c0b55330e318ac4f11a338c4d1b1218d0051369da	compared to the more main stream craft beer places, their ipa's actually taste pretty good. although their brew selection is on the smaller side, their selection of draft beers are all delicious and well thought out. in addition, they have some very unique mixed drinks including mojitos, old fashioned, strawberry vodka blends, and mint whiskey. while you can't drink all of them at once, the bartenders will gladly serve you any drink. definitely a good experience and excellent mixed beverages
0a2db8b133cb5167b0cd93ffcc6b45c3b3086e7fa8a2dd427a54332726fbfcaf	i liked the fried mozzarella most! haha. but the fried salmon was just as good. it's good for wanting to take a break from cooking. glad i found this place.
ed1283313c2d65abff02d184ed9edbe668b0acda38ec293957c86578eca2e0c7	a very good bar with select few beers, wines and liquors, but the quality is excellent. i loved the gold tequila margarita. the irish coffee is not bad either!
e1fb9eb3f15cb16846b1731c74c49d9819066057f20eff738205d6cab4d312b5	terrible service! tiny, cramped and dingy like a wild west tavern. all they're missing is a spitoon. our server was a tall, pudgy guy called lemmy who got our order wrong 6 times. the beer was warm and watered down and the fries were soggy.
2689ac8a57e7c902c7564bb70aeb27ccd6ddb9270dbc67e8ffa58f7bfcd36c95	everything was awesome here!  i've never had a drink or bad service!  from the pina coladas to the french fries it rocks!  their darks beers are a must try!  they also have many non alcoholic drinks to keep you refresh and wash down the drinks.
75d66afac8cc93f946167af2ecf3c6cd5efe1a770140cbac70b3d305d35626e2	a nice variety of items, about $2 beers during happy hour. i had a grape martini, which tasted just like grapes and was perfection. their pub food is really delightful! 100% real bacon on the smokehouse burger. crispy on outside and delectable. great little bar with awesome food.
28139da496a22bee183fab0b78244e42c870fea18ca1b2624354a3c420394226	raising cane's mixed drinks and cocktails are delicious...especially on a warm evening with friends. one of my faves is that they sell their mixed drinks by the pitcher so you don't have to keep ordering them. i wish they had a location in california.
9bee7812abcc7eb6fafc179320dcd163feb2a039674f807d3ecfac0b90e3cb31	i'm so happy that squeeze in is in las vegas. this is the best bar and grill place in vegas. a cool atmosphere and friendly staff match well with the cool beer and tasty snacks!
a9cd27112916a0bea328fe8db0e873af021e12c996c8f7467c6ebee5039bb3a6	guilty little pleasure stop. the tacos are totally great, smells good, cute waitresses. my daughter ordered a strawberry margarita took one drink and didn't want it. i tasted it and it tasted like straight ass. ipas are a 10, but stay away from the margaritas.
8b20d8129b4e0debd735299af7634d6c47e5c9990fd202bff060ccdd797c59dd	delicious margarita, and very nice chips and salsa
80a83a82f92eee89013822c31d554723f6ecb04e7c4bbc85d14f3f4b5af31dce	ordered the buffalo wings. yummy, though didn't really have a wow factor -- granted chicken wings are chicken wings. service 4 / 5.
353b96d154d10c807280500738d1a3b13f82e7a34b4438f2bed1059cd579961c	great beer. great hot wings and beer on tap. it has an outdoor patio.
3161c22e28d892ab526065345e0b2d946faddfb7fadd1241aec26b68a1379428	the beers are great but the bar owner is very rude. everytime i go in there she always have something rude to say. the drinks gets 5 stars and the bar owner gets no stars!
a6bb7c2252b39e92470018d1d2a5bec350b2fe24057c2dea3ac8ef0910cc5a68	what a bummer. i've tried quiet a few of their beers, waiting for 'the one' to scream out as me as being the god of all ipas. sadly, it never happened. the same boring craft beers, michelobs, heinekens and dos equis onion rings sucked too
d5d40142cbbb96aad3cf91ae8faf3ff203f0b90fdf9086f5c42c49c563d58c32	there really isn't anything special about this place. your run of the mill bar is tastier than this place and has better chicken fingers, onion rings and most likely a more experienced bartender, serving much better margaritas and white russians. i have been here twice now and am willing to drive the extra 2 miles to the sports bar place over on bell rd to get some of their chili cheese fries. if you have had really good bar food you will be a bit disappointed in the bland menu and sub par ingredients they use.
a87f1ded8bd43f6fba157f89680d05e32be4e79060a242ce767091a65b244673	picked up a cheeseburger, and have been eating it for dinner. they don't skimp on the cheese or the fries. also tried the onion rings... decent, but not the best i've had. my boyfriend had a patty melt which he enjoyed.
f500629018976fac0e7181110a5bf9647080640f177a97bb7a4d7a3d38edd140	if you want to eat really delicious bar snacks while you enjoy your drinks this is the right place. the onion rings are delicious and they have great bartenders too, i definitely recommend mariscos bar and grill.
ff8f0577cf80137727b86f2c72aeb40290b31cbc3f62cb3ddd3afb446e6ba398	some of the best wine that have ever graced my mouth. also, the pasta is to die for. every day i visit i debate whether i should buy a largebowl of soup to eat at home so that i can die of happiness.
539b6c2359318bc98b6c9161311ee07ea03340ec0ce6392e2a490bfb59cdb5d1	clean and modern bar with a small specialized menu. had the craft pale ale from the beer on tap and combination pretzel mix. the ale didn't have any froth in it and it tasted flat. the pretzel mix was tasty and well made. only came with plates of peanuts and a bowl of chips and salsa. tasty and inexpensive.
31844f05fbc5ed4f94f5d7ae6126750ddd5191481e790243eec41213681fcfaf	terrible burgers, worst of my life. all burnt...this place here on flamingo is a no-no spot. stale, warm beer. makes popeyes look like a 5-star restaurant.
901f74328fbd12970b49c94b325a330e2c5c474ac40491ba542d31b97df03eb6	great bar,  great food, very clean, as well as really friendly staff.  fries,  mozzarella sticks, and onion rings were very delicious.  i will definitely be going back.
561c486082082b0b513bfab55cef2a7531a2bc1e3808e779f3bbbaf625840822	my favorite cocktail place. i drive down from nlv to drink here on the weekends. simple mixed drinks and a great wine selection. they also have the traditional option of various beers. i'm a big fan of the martinis, california chardonnay, pale ale, and amber ale.
33c8913fdca25488bd658ef80faefd52a46dc40a0f125282a0b201e287f28bf5	i love their ipa beers, i go there daily and i just have to walk in and they have my craft beer ready!
c6843c363ff90d2974212d8c9d4466bcb46f7f7ebf7a93f17551d51e39882bcc	best pork rinds in the valley! i usually order the chicken wings! all the burgers are thick and tasty. also the nachos are perfection!
61b258fde5c4783e859e85c74dbdbe1af640b2f87db5b4d6d1b7be4d8169e7ac	between the fire display as you wait for a table and the elaborate beer on tap system; this wine and beer bar definitely screams "hip & cool." i had the white wine riesling from germany which was delicious and floral. the french merlot red wine is really good as well.
6857e4967f6fd1dd9fcdb0de5152cd5514fd45f608760ca2e3e9d35766b7c62e	i had bought some of craft beers. they were in seasonal flavors like oktoberfest, pumpkin beer, hoppy beers etc. the bar was decorated with jerseys, memorabilia, and other sports-themed items. it looked awesome! the onion rings were awesome and were just the right amount of flavor!
8f078166a2e7ef1c6da9a858ef63403b4f31eb75cbf97481fc0bacfdfd01e71b	mamas bar and grill was simply fantastic. tamra, our bartender, was awesome and made our night out wonderful. the drinks and bar snacks were delicious, the lager was cold and refreshing, and the hot wings and mozzarella sticks were to die for. the home made onion rings with cheese were so good! definitely recommend them when you're at mamas for your next night out drinking.
1b4d0cddc27fe84386b819b22cffdc0bd59b92bc51c3c0c591066a190adc300f	slowest place ever! and never fails every time i come here they always forget my vodka! juice without alcohol really.
a7f61d22d2af51887aa2cc4e9958e527908251a75391e1d6ad2b0317c6f98939	came to try the grilled chicken the prepackaged chickens were cold and slimy and their breadsticks on top of that had a very thick buttery consistency. their wine choice was also very limited
c64bcfc1d0808a5399c8357b097f6820397d51ffb58eae29eba59537a386ca95	this is a great place for drinks with great service. i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great lunch or a quick bar style dinner..
a2754b44723b793d9ae96efddc304c69570a8e5b2b78f912c43f8c67cb50c2c0	had the mozzarella sticks and the fair trade beer. both were good. better than micky's. give it a try.
3177e518a874827617babef40a6adfff94a09f74033722829c1474fa1026bd9d	it appears this bar finally closed. there's now a sign up saying there's a filiberto's bar and grill coming soon. i wish bar establishment would open up there instead of filiberto's.
4f11a861cc224c9ec955fbdfde08ecfc1909dea48eecf3121abd7aebeedc163c	where do i start? hot wings.... freaking yummy!!! pretzel mix... yummy... and the chicken bites so moist and juicy, not greasy or or nasty. i cannot wait until the bar on the west side of town is finished so we can eat and drink at it more often. wish they had a few more options on the craft beer on tap but in all.. most of my family love corona and craft beers. thanks canes!
d4262bacd8f94fa7ed19759bb39c8c735edcd8602418047061ef4e8c861fe959	i love everything they serve here. i got at least once a week for the mixed drinks or a plate of chicken wings at the flying monkey bar.
afd66718b39bc2b7233139071016daa2238990853351897f0a47d38f621955e2	great experience and awesome show of skill to make the different specialty drinks. the bartender did a great shaken not stirred martini.  i had the riesling white wine from germany.
566df918a5160a7eee3d16633b3d755dfc824162b2f6717ce2f96490f1599835	i love fro yo and i frequently satisfy my taste buds at any opportunity i get. this bar gets high reviews because of its unique drinks that i can't find at other bar. the thai flavor beer i got last time blew my mind. they always have a good variety of tart and sweet drinks. they have a lot of options of alcohol and i love their bar food. they are also very friendly.
a9e5dbcc2e3455e5639ba137c34ac75cf0f5c3627588f61f01a8a039d72f6c80	i'm writing this review as i'm having an awesome beer with some chili cheese fries - so good!  i also decided to try their potato skins today - also really good.  i definitely recommend this place for a nice cold one and some fairly low in price appetizers.
f16405295c67470d45f7c12cc5f8091716c46eb0b19247e034b27401deb9ad12	delicious beers and drinks. what isn't on the menu can be made to order. all very tasty. i will return.
266e5d26b0d1363fe764c5100a4f2201a8c0e7bd48ffbb372849b9e7b0fdbe65	i think it's a top 3 bar in chicago! i ordered a bottle of wine, some chocolate, and a chips with cheese sauce. amazing food. can't wait to go back - thank you john!
dd2bcb6cd2e8d47a5169574f5dbc16e21d838bf4fbdaa81b376fcbeade1f608a	extremely underwhelmed today. won't be back. i'll stick with bosa cheese burgers for better value and taste.  the beer is cheaper too.
e4b548180e18d4d906f507de4f27b5a93844a41d8b045ec02cc755391a0e6169	my husband and i were craving some burgers and beers during our honeymoon in vegas, and came across the burger bar in a visitors guide. it's inside the gold coast hotel on flamingo. it's a small bar tucked inside the casino and the food and drinks were excellent. we ordered bacon kobe bruger and the sweet potato fries for dinner. the portions and drinks were perfect for the price. we will definitely try and come here again.
c4febc562a25626425fa2ea9634214f43fe1033f6aee81336258e77cbdfb3dd6	best food of my life. never going back to glory days or my local pub ever again. i'm a changed man. 11 / 10 would eat the foods here again. my god, so reasonably priced. i'm driving across town every friday just to get the wine coolers here. never change your recipes or management. everyone needs to eat and drink here. these people deserve bonuses. the wings cooked here are serenaded to sleep before they're seasoned and served to perfection. the long wait at the counter is only a minor barrier to the tastiest bar food ever, and the lagers offered are to die for.
2b832c8d75b93e93ee4b05e2ea1f2cc9cb3d16a18f6255e83330d7665b6d0008	good quality bar appetizers. there is nothing to complain about on their potato skins or cheese sticks! even the dipping sauce is amazing, as is their selection of beers. glad i'm in love with their offerings.
9c1ff63d3f399165df1f6f0b519eadbde31b66ef91ddde290a75439fce61b79e	been going for their cocktails for many years now and still have the best martinis and mojitos. everything is carefully made by the bartenders and reminds us of our many trips to rocky point and the amazing beverages we enjoy on our trips! many thanks for the great mixed drinks!
087eb10accbfc1833d0edd69bc4128c087f20080b9294cadfa00c706709fe30e	i love their selection of beers and appetizers, especially the cheese sticks! to top that off, they provide fast service as well, which is unusual for a bar. i come here every week, great place to unwind after work.
70864ab154837251cada73fd4d1f66502aa373ce6a446721bb7b7aa6e9158021	love the space and the food. my only comment is that employees shouldn't eat in view of customers. a big no no. a worker was chomping down a cheeseburger from behind the bar counter. while five people stood in line to pay, watching her. very off putting.
5d7f756aa99a9c7b0c1ce9fe09f10247eed3b0b0bd3dd9837f0b871ccff894e0	i'm not sure why i gave this restaurant another try. nasty grilled chicken that come out cold and soggy. their so soups are not even edible. you'd never even guess this was a restaurant. anyways even that tasted horrible. nothing came out hot or even warm. don't try their breadsticks, they're hard as a rock. also pretty sure the wine was colored water
887af8869a7e9d7606478945ea4c7541b2d057cc278a8a486433637fcd3ee960	ronald's tavern makes mostly lean cheeseburgers and no one can tell the difference. delicious! their french fries and gravy (covered with gravy and cheese curds inside) are my faves!
c1db54ed8001d8e6b511d5bf6757295d0a4b08e713bee46ca671f868c49472fa	i had a great midnight snack here. the onion rings and buffalo wings were over the top. breanna was a super server too. and the mozzarella sticks were scrumptious, great wine selection too.
74a10d4d34f0883f581a3f8456e14c394119109a92a602f3f39b658fcae0f3f5	fry time! homemade and delicious. i have had the homemade fry dishes and they are all pretty good. the nachos are bomb.com (great!).
6523913f595c2cb1aa5887a8ab4856b76435f21ea254468566e65636b74ce63b	fantastic!  beers cold, great wines. quick service and great happy hour specials
944e098a9402f309d2a54eec688dae41f41908348746502b26bdb73616d45236	celebrity hyped tap room = over priced beers $22-25 for a freakin "celebrified" russian imperial stout? i don't think so guys!  that's all these bartenders try to sell when they also sell normal domestic beers.  save your money and spend it at the craft brewery next door... aloha!!!
e13e9f1b965b1d0f036e3a7dbc6cab6cf6bfd7e66c8f89c1d82c2e2f44ac80e8	one of my favorite craft brew spots. i even bring my friends from work here to try out the mixed drinks and ipa brews. the draft beer is very cheap but the quality is great. the onion rings and mozzarella sticks are definitely fresh. cocktails that normally cost $16 for a small glass only cost around $7 here. their wine list is also good, but i normally stick to their french red wines.
12d6933b229c74430ec9130c4cb5245a07b3775084cbc06bad2b6b1581712278	was hearing about this cocktail bar and wanted to give it a try man what a change, love this bar...the cosmopolitans and long island iced tea were just strong enough and delicious which i love. so glad there is a bar in walking distance to me, the bartenders are friendly and the first time ordering was a breeze, the bartenders are very skilled great service.
9ccb2c5fc44fdf2222f7ccc517c455a8cc680b9441ab1d6283bba8bb3eecc1c5	great bar food close to home! husband and i go here often after dinner, grab a drink and walk on the danforth:) sometimes we even have to call a cab to pick us up from the bar.
3fbf43c77997dcaef4e27b15acc880cbedc5e24160ff433f462c2d3ebd10558b	seriously one of my favorite bar and grill restaurants.  i can't eat at the chain bar restaurants anymore because this place takes bar food to the next level. even my girlfriend and her family loves this place. when it's hot out, try their cold craft beers, they have the best locally crafted beers.. their garlic fries and buffalo wings are delicious.
a2766fe60d0dbf7b831af2bc4523c8ef1f2b916d4239004b041034f20c19eb6d	to call this place a bar is tantamount to treason. ordering process was clunky. not easy to tell pricing -- ended up getting uncharged $4 on my cheesburger for things like mustard and ketchup that are standard fare at fast casual chains like anywhere else. food quality was average -- certainly didn't merit the premium pricing of a $12-14 burger. staff was friendly and helpful.
3fb921fe21bc87aa5e3fbd4beac5f1297f806d8a419275b20106258120e980f9	it's great that after graduating from pitt 16 years ago, i can bring my friends here for their excellent chicken wings. they were making the home made fries right in front of us and the wings are just so delicious. nothing better..... anywhere!
3795147782e09b8d19685d3a2ade66f3b8d70d021349f1199abd380d5b91351d	wonderful lunch bar. delicious chips and salsa. the local brewed tequila makes a tasty margarita! the specials are a great value. i keep going back for more pale ales and full bodied lagers (the special craft beer on tap)
b4fb9f10722fa317214fcf1204359ecbd9f40b595c6f1a1a38f2ea99e755d8cf	great place to eat. close to my house and and my girlfriend loves it here. got 2 big burger meals for about 10 $less the outbackwell worth it. will be back tomorrow for more burgers and want to try their fish burgers and bacon fries. might even ask for some mozzarella sticks and chili cheese fries
b204fa111a2cde2cc33b651003459cb9887fd72fa389d01365e98bf325536d6a	mediocre hot wings here - if you are in the area and want a quality bar snack, this place might be better than glory days,  but it is nothing to go out of your way for.
8e669e8b04011948c35203415eb651bf1ea6de3f0e89a302a994c43c7d02d2f9	i believe that the owner of this bar wrote the book on customer service. the bartenders treat you like royalty and the drinks and food are excellent. if you want a delicious affordable meal and stiff drinks off the strip, this bar is the place to go!
a56983d2ddbfec393ca576a2295f8adedea48b6d0566181736e2c3a9b12188a9	the cocktails were soooo delicious, but the real gem is the frozen tejuino (which i still can't pronounce). tried a few other cocktails besides the aforementioned drink, along with some snacks, and enjoyed them. absolutely delicious drinks. my only regret is that i cant go back more often.
c2b3d801603ec2260f997de9d2314eff6f1e3eeb23c77565bf62547b07a246fb	this is the typical bloody mary, but i felt compelled to write a review of this bar because every time i am in here, they are always very nice. this is a regular stop for me and will be for some time.
f29e4a9ff6117c29449dc5a303f6fd61cc96d03f94cfbef86851003e6c75cb11	growing up in america, cheeseburgers are a childhood favorite. i live in ia, so there are no locations near by. which is why whenever i go to vegas, i make it a point to visit this bar. this time around, i had cheeseburger, fries, and onion rings! everything was as delicious as i remember. all of the staff were very kind, courteous, and welcoming.
67c109877abff3519c88934a69ed7142801973a3ce02b9a46021ad0c57e46e9b	my friend recommended the bacon burger with fries, and i was no disappointed. the burger was so refreshing, the later tasted like they were right out of the fryer. i also tried the local beer, and it was great. it's a nice place to hangout but the tables needed some cleaning.
695eb135698860768287bb6754572e19669a2fc20d487005920cfdda99f4dfb2	fantastic! had the red wine and a vodka shot. companion had a beer. i would drive to waxhaw just for this.
c317352e2192c49bb11d28988cf63c5a09f5a9a4209c56070d3ea71eb90e195d	gross, microwaved food, slow service from the bartender, cheap beer, mixed drinks are watery mess. nachos are awfull. much better bars then this bar, go somewhere else for bar food, taco bell would be better.
cad86d284ce5a88593cbb29d392f762617a4184a05b76b6b736fb1c12914aeff	great local ipas. nice small town bar feel. this will make your weekends enjoyable. if you're in town, i suggest you stop by. go for it!
82035490253e4445887c21ad2aa49dabc168310702639e97f0b0c7bf541023b4	it's worth the wait in line at this bar on any weekend. hands-down far superior to an dive bar or franchise bar. bar staff even for a busy day was on top off our cold beers and our tables order all came out correct. the burgers were excellent to the point there wasn't even leftovers. super large portions but so good you'll eat it all
1652f6b057d4d0d8ac11eda65f32685a84250203f762990eac53bd0c82613c7a	just had dinner at this bar. i ordered the buffalo wings and fries... awesome!! the wings reminded me of a wing stop and the fries were seasoned just like i like. all for six dollars.... definitely will check it out again if i'm in the area.
75d6ec1a97d22326444fba00fb9b48abeaffa694fdcb78ec19b855d8928f31d6	the buffalo wings are great and the german lagers are just okay overall i like this place a lot though and will be come back to try some different beers and wines.
632f9fba0726d52639d48b27dfe04dd18c3767733357f4d870e0e6b2da3251f5	best cocktail bar i have been to. bartenders were very quick and friendly. reasonably priced for hand crafted cocktails.
64ad367747908236c32aea8764090819b0f17cff21a6bb744780bc5c85b1e2a9	excellent bar nice little place good beer on tap. pale ales check. out of control frothy lagers. wife liked her reisling white wine from germany. low prices. basically a sure thing.
73f3a65fe57b491f099bfea15b64ddf7725ca8b137b9e0ac9e4fadbbb9dd07f8	not that great it was not worth the price service was bad i got the cheeseburger not good at all  cause i heard good things will never come here again
e2d82f92c6d663bceb2593201bcc4820e6b0cb45e832ebd98ca6e3995ed9663f	ordered chicken tenders, tastes awfully greasy, nothing like authentic bar food. i ordered a large beer, tried hard to eat as much chicken as possible to show politeness, failed.
65f2ff35409908ef884ecc3ed25671569d6a02488f5a83de95124c004b28ce03	wow surprising last minute options! delicious beers! not ur average bar place. cute decor! great drinks and cheap to be precise. service was on point too for a hole in the wall bar!
566e9ae6cfffb81a73f6161d3e8e535278cff2839c71ca279a010e0d3357bc44	my every friday happy hour joint. the margaritas are great and the philly cheese steak sandwiches are amazing. even at 3am the bartenders are great...
2d1e0c857b11f1e2b2ae54aba6f8270f1e387b30ff3c3b7b5ae3469bb0825c96	this was the worst bar experience ever! after being seated, 15 minutes passed before anyone even started mixing my drink. i tried to flag down a different bartender who told us he was too busy making drinks for other customers. long story short, over 30 minutes passed before i even got my first wine cooler. i like to try different places but i'll never try this bar and grill in huntersville again.
d4d984e1261b4303acd4d66a0e25bcc493f3ff07a092d945a3aeb1eb3daccffb	bob's has awesome food. love the cheeseburger and really good fries. we also ordered from them to cater a party and delivery was on time and all the food was excellent.
9c6b909c6d13cd6a65859879188627dd7ffff7738821094b991e6402a803b476	just had a simple beer and french fries but it was some of the best i've ever had. we will for sure be back.
c56c8c8a3908e6fc2d6751360bfd34bbb184c6406d7f5820f2c3ff5bc1c5069c	they have the best buffalo wings. i also recommend the lobster bites and the spring rolls. the best mixed drink is the mai tai.
05e3482aef24e30a8b984a761fe7fef43e7828aa36cee32438f6c9ebc2df6241	just awful. so called cosmopolitan was sweet and terrible... just a glass of sugar and a tiny bit of alcohol. reminiscent of drinks from the 90s but worse.
fa8068a1bd5f77ebb60070e4bf7c3b1e1abe676f06c221fc1639e9c2d4da2da6	warm drinks and it took about 5 minutes to order with the bartender because she wasn't paying attention
1607b6492878b775235a384edb5ca9cba6aabf0b615be936e40020728ebecc6f	the only speakeasy bar i will go anymore, attentive, fast and great service. their cheese burgers and mixed drinks are like no other!
515113c0bdb804ad0078650d8d0404452819af4511daa00e0c868ac98382a42d	la ristra is the place to be! the cocktails were bomb. jared our bartender was very attentive and on top of it. we will definitely become their new regulars haha
9f2c0c5f7aabd748cdf3ff3afd236cc619c32dfe828ae2297358b4891408d8de	coming from the bay area where there are millions of great bars, i have to say that this pub is pretty good.  who would have thought in az? the beer is amazing.  i love the wine selection.
72d1fd3c9461ee46425797b2e56f65dbf21e3cb400d9ef0193a5c8647e40dc74	not sure what this place is but it's not a craft beer brewery. the pale ale tastes like hops and water. no lagers. the stout was bland... we will not be back
97f2f279cc146ec0a3383a811358ab135d40a3fc6fd7578803f2339c5aa7f466	the seasoned fish and triple patty burger was amazing! the place is clean and has a great atmosphere but the bar was limited when i went. but thankfully i didn't need any wine because their soda was amazing. next visit i'm trying their bacon burgers with fries.
a4f11f3fd86826fdc6cd7cc706c42b0a3bb55ce600918bdcd4f0364c25dab43c	it's a hole in the wall bar so i think legally i cant give it 5 stars. i placed my order with the bartkeep and the drinks came fast and the french fries came out perfect. the staff including pete are all super friendly and really make an effort. this pub is better than your average drinking spot.
b9d4a432eda4c4bf99053263b22d11fc11f904858b4f1c8b2d2a862fedc06db3	ice n brews is a delightful bar in the heart of shops at don mills. i got a single cheeseburger and curly fries and it tasted great. they also offer a variety of different margaritas i wanted to try such as mango, strawberry, cherry, kiwi, and more. it can get pretty busy, good thing there are plenty of seats and tables outside. definitely will come back again to try their chicken wings and tater tots.
aac70bf84108f783f47273599db1a4cde7fd089f766cccb61f835fe8c9ca7bde	pink box is my go to place for snacks and drinks shop. i've tried many of their cocktails and these are my favorites: the white russian, whiskey sour, cosmopolitan, long island tea and their bartender makes a simply fantastic margarita. not sure if you noticed but i love anything sweet or tart, so long as its got alcohol:) they've got great chicken fingers and fried chicken livers too. the bar is cute & clean. staff are always nice & friendly. pink box is always a hit with family, friends and out of towners.
90073403ce5c0f9838381ee51cbd2b784ca6fbd44b192d447277d128e3ba0559	a good, local ipa and chips. this is all you need. the beer is strong, great taste,  and local and the chips? crunchy, fresh and amazing. the appetizer changes from day to day but so far we haven't had a bad one. 5 stars all day
97c9d9a683bfba0e2fa8007018c9daaf5b001efbb776e0b9cbf39554e0c6c034	the worst amber ale i've ever had. not much color, not much taste, and watered down beer from a tap... do yourself a favor and go to a bar with better craft brews and draft beers! actually i hope the owners go have one too, and fix their brews!
2a7ff1208112989e403322288ec47b9eb1c8a84d1c0e2067cfcb1eeca630b3b4	it was okay. kinda right there with the local bars - nothing great, but nothing horrible. we had 2 appetizers and some wings - the chicken tenders and fries were nice. the chicken tenders were a bit greasy and i kept burping aftertaste all evening - but were ok. it was all ok - but just ok
f32a1b31855f3cec1d04bd62f0c413780ba48b6d3c8c2cefd035d6b609b65b89	let me just start by saying, kurk's kitchen is the only bar i would gladly drive from mississauga to toronto just to get my daily fix of grilled fish and fries also their chicken wraps are amazing! service is incredible, everybody makes you feel at home once you walk through the door. amazing food, can't get enough! i always order their red wine along with my meal, fried salmon and bacon fries, has browns, tater tots, all are amazing highly recommend them!
3a33d00bbb7ead51a0c1e4c4ea4cd0a22a6bcb751b1151a75c51d900c8908c2f	any place that has authentic mexican beer and italian wine on the drink menu gets a 5 from me.
fd355d5e5d1a4b6cadcc1866ade26307a5ca4c8b79ab85af84563655c58ce07f	snooze!!! what a fantastic place. well worth the wait. have been twice in the last three days. omg sex on the beach drink is very well named. this morning tried the poutine, carrot cake pancake, chicken wings & turkey sliders with fries and bacon bits. i can't choose a favorite! the food and drinks rock and the service is top notch. my new favorite place!
347d331c0157230e54d446fef49963cde4199adba9420d08d5cf51ae8ec84534	i have tried their draft brews three times now and they have the worst fermented beverages in cleveland. the onion rings and hot wings were great, but skip the beer and order a cocktail if you go.
502c9c0d1ff79fcb30a478542ff4cb30787f39be62d886e0081763195c8f09a4	great bartenders, great drinks. great fried goods. love this spot!
0317c1bfac3952839db8386a1f4b6f6c7cce00da27eacfddbc4e3245d78b09cd	this is a great bar to have a small snack with your drink! their home made ranch sauce is so creamy, but not too rich - i dip my cheese sticks in it. i also got a peach flavored beer the last time i was there - it was very good!
013989dc78b5bb393b3f0c43c13d0730bbc5700731f7b2853e2233a6173a9ec2	definitely bar food, not pub fare. have yet to order something we didn't like. the combo's are the way to go for the best money. the hot wings are our favorite. the place is clean and the bartender is friendly.
1df01b74568ac1acf5f26de16c1a1bf4f15e65bc173b021ac50952ef045ff04d	this place is great for taking home chicks. shots are only a couple dollars and the ratio is always good, three girls to one guy.  my favorite live band always sets the mood, food is on point and they have giant shrimp
9e90e607f98c98dfa3c7bafa2bdab9cb08cf7d45f29c71880c32e2189109eaee	great food here. i tried the fried onion rings, homemade buffalo wings, and the peel and eat shrimp. all were very tasty. i also enjoyed the wine and beer selection, the house lagers were great. great place!
27af73c1c15db121bc1765bffd122d4af963f403e649ca004d4e7c23e4763678	the owner gave me a sample of the fries before i bought onion rings. the beers were absolutely terrific. the patty melt was also fabulous. can't wait to come back for more!
d5d7cd8fb4f097a0f554877e7182d0efd949bcbedaf56f7da47294a5c4aa4466	great bar with a variety of drinks to choose from. it was packed late in the afternoon. everything tasted great and was flavorful. i liked that the drink combos were so cheap and come with fresh french fries
a6dbb38f0472dd21182537754481eef2c1c17b7c5f375838777a5a43da10b089	it's a chain, so the drinks are consistent. bartenders were great...but the hot wings and mozzarella sticks were just ok for me. i usually avoid buying craft beers, but went here for a birthday, and had fun drinking their brews. this time the hot wings were good, our bartender was super nice and we had a great. because of this i give their fermented goods a higher rating than normal.
c1db84ec0763644a38357e4dc971f4ccb59d9ca70f285e56f31a49d84e0eb27a	i ordered a craft pale ale, the indian pale ale, on tap, a side of spicy chicken wings, and the house pretzel mix. i ask for extra beer and it's almost 30 cents for a top up of a pint of the beer. to top it off the chicken wings were stale, pretzels in the mix were rock hard, and the pale ale was more froth than actual beer. never going back to this bar.
2de1f4b53db32ab77e3682251c9e263db663b590515220d9a80bf91cbd0c6615	super good cheeseburgers! homemade pickles. lots of great drinks. it was a hot summer day so i went with something refreshing: two moscow mules, one each of black raspberry vodka and strawberry vodka. loved it!
ca2826cca5fe560ca83014fed442334f44f46bab1386c96b849e7727331deb85	as a first timer at viva las arepas in las vegas, i was impressed! great cocktails with pretty garnishes! i had the mojito. so delicious and different with mint throughout. not as strong as the margarita but great nonetheless. the margarita was delicious & full of flavour. definitely a favourite but would only have one as they are quite strong! great service & didn't have to wait long.
be9191c93e125dfc2f79dc44ec15b147c2ec6bcd117ea52c0f4378ab67c79001	this is the best place for bar food at a reasonable price! my favorites were the nachos and mozzarella sticks the wings and jalopeno poppers are also great. i highly recommend it here.
12a16f3704606d3b44f089b2c77e79d79a43f5e3a3bea722727c3cecee6f86ab	his is the best italian place in the gta. the pizza i normally opt for is the meat lovers (everything on it, pepperoni, meatball and sausage). the food is undoubtedly fresh, quantities are great, sauces (alfredo, tomato) are awesome! lunchtimes (12pm) are busy, so try to come at 11am or 1pm onwards.
ffd04d5ebab0117074660cab22062c6f76e7c01726c6c2be1824e6ee22198644	very good place for mixed drinks. had the vodka soda and it was decent. the mojitos and old fashioneds looked amazing. our bartender samantha was great.
df17ac7e2bdb5b07794ef6d86282549092a16681cc11899a89ce43106c9fa075	mmmmm delicious cocktails, you can taste the carefully prepared drinks from blocks away. good wine selection too.
b6de1ddfe760018c4e3c9064c9dacdb92c8c6748f867b0dfbbab52a4bd64203f	friendly staff but beer wasn't great (in fact, the pale ales were super dry and bitter.... stomach is bubbling right now) and did not compare to pei wei's that i've been to. the beer on tap menu here is very limited. no lagers or blonde ales at all. didn't even have american red ale. i would suggest taking a chance on another place to drink at this airport.
4e19b2a66d3020538e7e4bf025a242416ab4e6fbc7518ce70e87e28917d17f1a	came here for the beer and wings since they looked really delicious on the ad.. but i think alehouse beer and wings are better... fries were pretty tasty
de9a5c7e69961b9a016746d1b08687df7e94e2e6a2ff66b120169d119b8f7163	i had the bacon cheeseburger and it was fantastic. it was authentic american bar food at its finest and for a good price. i hear the onion rings are legit so i will be coming back soon to try it.
42289952c1e58c8380129526ea17e3d3aff7e52597edfcede23698fbd9a2b86e	great place for a drink or late night wings. much better than the other local watering holes.
9b950f078656f8a60c7cc64420c3bc2351a3159bf7e82758cfca82957bad6bda	no stars! if i could i would. just horrible service what more can i say. i go to dq for the different wines from all over the valley and this has to be the worst wine bar. dirty wine store and attitudes is not a great summer wine tasting trip. they didn't have a good selection of merlot or reislings either. the wine was flat and bitter. stay away
938fdaca46bb2d9d92f433ea61298b895039070ccae567e130fd9becafee43ff	what a great place for late night drinking!! the grove bar makes for a really nice setting for a party and they do have them there!! the bar food is very good!! the grilled chicken nachos, curry turkey nachos and the farm fresh draft beers are all incredibly.
6d062924d1a169859aecece7ce16b4a488ebff510e8a99acb5fe4d3ecbfbad6a	love their mixed drinks and brews. it was busy at the bar, but we found a stool right away and the bartender served us quickly. i would go back for their martinis and cocktails.
8ae70ffa9c802ed492609a21bbb94ef4530be0b3a85897fd6b13700bdfc726b2	some of the best craft beers i have ever had! the pale ale was amazing with just the right blend of flavors. i went during happy hour to sample the amber ale. the lagers and malts were on point. their hot wings were cooked perfectly! i may have to come back to las vegas just to go to this bar!
ad6e61666ece446a16dec6c22242102632b06de63fdc63ced3e6f12aede4dd48	i had never eaten at this bar and grill before this location opened and now i am a serious fan. the deep fried chicken wings have been reborn for me and i also love the pork rinds. that other bar is going to take a hit for sure. bring your appetite, eat more chicken wings
13aaffa593f78d0e7c634c5cf134ae7e661c381bc2d9c334e17c682701b4f2bf	this place is a disgusting hellhole! never would have thought the nice view from outside could house the filth that lies within. the taco meat was beyond spoiled! worms in the fries, roaches on the bar table. threw up 3 times that day. had some tequila shots to hold down my lunch- very gross and filthy!
a6c77bc9fb4b86ca4d28b01134fdba3978063d29f5d808cb10e500e0b3afcd2f	i am a frozen margarita freak, and have had the raspberry one, which is the gold tequila standard to me-- i have to say, this bar great drinks and nice employees, excellent  liquor selection, i would highly recommend this location to anyone who loves margaritas!!
ff5fc7b08cedc9b1a635f377648db93a3fe80c96190d6d35cf45302b8f5a39ff	had the fried fish. ask for extra breadsticks, it is fresh and wonderful flavor. my wife had the short ribs, they were juicy, tender and with the best bbq sauce you've ever had. great spot if you have transportation from the strip. you can't go wrong with their lamb burgers either.
40ff04c373258636f695208f306419203e7c5675b9693fd0ae39492cba12ef60	my husband and i are picky about ipas, but this place was a welcome surprise. we sampled a few local beers that were all excellent! also we enjoyed the fact that they also had some great appetizers.
93067dbcf083be7d8f4215f8067aa09307a50f80328053273d7648a5ae685aea	the bar and grill to go to in scottsdale. beautiful aesthetic, thoughtful and greasy bar food dishes, wonderful service. you have to get: cheeseburgers - black angus cheese steaks - brisket sandwiches - any combo of fries, onions rings or cole slaw
77b6ffa78e582a3dc25764e4f4cd9e114495e37873d6d0e06d213256ca492833	so i just moved down the street and wanted to give a new cocktail bar a try. we ordered long island iced teas, mojitos, and cosmopolitans. everything was good but hte cosmopolitans were by far our favorite. the only con was that the drinks were a little on the weak side. but they are a nice twist on a cocktail bar. the bartenders are super nice. we can't wait to try out more drinks.
210f33af29ebec1f3989103b0d30dddd450b8b47f3df5403a6be4f4fc5907f6f	very good price!  about 5 bucks for a beer, and unlimited chip refill during happy hour.  flavor and service are ok.  trying different beers is a fun experience.
8c2b9e7cd407ec11c920922af242dd823d046b577e4907bb1bf6fa6881f40661	good food and good people make this a favorite bar food spot for our friends. the burgers are always juicy and the onion rings are large and delicious.
66a12fdaa095c5d7eedf67be754fefaaef499f6c645f0c13097409be1fb48062	unreasonable beer orices, lotssss of flies and bugs / our busboy was an clumsy obese guy with body odor who kept spilling our drinks our experience didn't go well
d9e2cb0fb3d68ca77c5df43e1c0029e9a9719b66a582469edd74e65656d8c778	better than buffalo wild wings? yes! i was very impressed with this place. not only were the wings delicious, the prices were very reasonable, and the staff is exceptionally kind. they give you complimentary mozzarella sticks while your food is being prepared, a variety of popcorn and dips (the pub cheese is very good). lastly, they make some pretty good vodka sodas as well. highly recommended.
4bd68f605e004a05d3f4fb75deb199c0f321cc24c0d56c616cbd8bfc64e8a5e4	university blvd charlotte nc... bar... service and food was no way pleasing! i have tried this one twice and was very displeased.......... the bars in gastonia are much better...
a82d42560c386c78fd69d2c90545507a22bf062eeeb088ee581aa0429315f8e3	customer service it top notch at this applebees restaurant. bartender rewashed our table as she didnt likw the way it looked. even wiped the bar menus before giving them to us. bar waitress was very attentive. evan asked if i wanted a cold beer to go. we have never had this high quality of service at any other applebees. kudos to your bar staff for all your hard work. keep up the amazing job. oh.. and the big cheeseburgers were very good too. bob & karen
9a53ec0a54df18370fb180d4902ca455683d0cf737d0743f8001eb5af1a88261	we ordered a variety of finger foods from their menu. we had the bone-in wings, which really lacked flavor and the sauce seemed watered down. the fries were good, but not great. we tried the fried pickles and onion rings. they both seemed soggy, the dough itself was not that great. the whole experience was mediocre.
b79f3261895be1880548f9c3c2bea3b86534322bef2268cedb92ebe321da60ef	this was a cool little bar with a great option to eat out under the trees. i loved their chili cheese fries, buffalo wings with celery and blue cheese and great selection of beers on tap and fine scotch!
253a0bf1c5905ce716f497fa4932ad7b966c20602c86ffdb402db84946229683	the double cheeseburger was really yummy. the chicken tenders were amazing with honey mustard tastes and you could build your own sandwiches here. we also got cheesesticks. the cheesesticks okay but the other dishes were better! the service was a little slow but ask for a side of honey mustard-it's fantastic!!!
3df415dc6ec38b4da6fff2585ad8110768eb9a6fc343228f2269cfebc2c44016	since my first visit, i have been back at least loads of times. drive thru is usually a little slow. i usually order grilled steak, their meat is far more flavorful (and spicy) than outback's and their grilled chicken is far more superior. i think their soup menu is amazing too. definitely go for happy hour to get the best draft beer, and wine specials
0c356854141b45dd348ca6c04e0b352c60cd2ed2cd566a91bee66b24ac3ae5e4	all you can eat was amazing! juicy cheeseburgers and great service! the burger melts in your mouth like butter.
9b873c19d68b4911c658f365c743960435669cde5776031202e596d2962eaaa6	the staff is friendly and attentive. they serve coffee outside for people waiting, which is very nice, as the nights can get cold here. the wings are great. i would recommend the original flavor, and the garlic parmesan flavor was alright, too. also, if you want some mimosas, it's much cheaper to get a couple of mimosas than two individual mimosas! two is always better than one.
338c36564882d72aa71b5bdd6a662d47e6f1cf7d9e4b13dd732b5b4de1fe71dc	craft beers and mixed drinks? yes. is the wine selection legit? yes. will return for the onion rings? yes. wasn't it expensive? who cares,  you must order the bruschetta.
47287db0e44b490210c247946b65a418724ece6f5d4e45cf98d43637bedc8af7	one of my favorite bars in wisconsin! tonight was my second time having one of their brews & it confirmed my love of their great beer selection. our bartender was thoughtful & attentive. the onion rings and mozzarella sticks were fresh and delicious! everyone had a very nice time...
60ffe08f21df0da3075277af00bab3ea7b87fd2bd292ecc7e83d81d8b9654d1a	best onion rings and cheese fries. great service, great drinks, good bunch of servers murals are amazing good artwork great for snacks and drinks. open late tastes oh so great.. highly recommended
933b68b3361c4299ea66edb0e808b0ce73cc75311e4332a4d722da48a6143aea	i have loved their ipa brews all my adult life, i'm 48! that's saying something about how good their craft brews are! always a great and giving bar in eastlake. long live their fermented brews!
e1245b422a7f7b3c0a75f9a0cd76a7fe59df6df707015adf937a0d9e25a6d18d	i had the mozzarella sticks and burger sliders. they were amazing and juicy! i would definitely recommend this place i love bar food. it is way better than legends.
81f7a888891fb7262085ec1230143cb6a0adf6ebf79b3296b1ded8a195343a06	martinis were amazing! i had an appletini and hubby had an ipa. both were cold and delicious. the appletini wasn't too sweet and tasted great. this is a small, cash only bar. definitely worth a stop in montreal.
9e95faa7340fed9c7751cdae7a50321b78915c63335729163105b4558ecfa59c	i really enjoyed my first meal from the bar. the bar food and drinks were great. definitely will go there again.
c616d4fced7176d317ef8ae3fd95d0d7d4ccd48e5ba6ebe09c621fb876f4a682	these mixed drinks are delicious and cheap! they are much more tasty than other local bars and much cheaper. my favorite is the long island ice tea! the staff and owners are always nice and remember me when i come in!
e92208bae51d014757d7c0093be1bae9190e96ca83948441cf1e2378202a83f4	fantastic bar and amazing unique drinks! this is a definite must if you want a great bloody mary or mixed drink experience.
52718cffa75d54c765595df9a8bb103936345700a095c32a72bb47f89c2f9a4e	locals craft brewery spot with great pale ales & beer on tap & friendly service. good selection of largers too. always good. open for lunch & dinner.
b774ab42fd917ba5f22580ec8ec85b2d3926c432291eb4e5cb693bee2f8c370a	i had a long island ice tea and it was great.
a9f5cc116e0b7554663af0609aeb8f2a57f26b90ac889641d4185c0b9d8c252c	first thing i noticed is that this place is not oily like other bars or grills. you get nice clean tastes to the broth and meat. we got the grilled chicken, their breadsticks were amazing and very buttery with a side of vegetables. services was five out of five.
dbae393706fe9f1e95c73dc2bb2511fd370172fdc38e917a49d34b755eba8ae7	so excited they're back!!! best beer on tap in vegas. attentive service and great pale ales and lagers.
aec87dfbbbf0eec252a44f663117f10745881eac80d0d093afd9dbc23f37e14d	great price on my draft beers. too bad it closed last week. i'll have to go to the other bar to drink for $2 now.
6275581b8a171f3f8c25e007baef3da231c9140cc534429bb49ed0d2bcec0771	i dream of the days when i had a bar from my work. that being said i miss you, alcohol too! they give an adequate amount of alcohol in your drink which makes me a happy girl. the variety is perfect and the wine is seemingly very tasty.
c71dd43568a4e68fa965dc36029d5b13495bbb7ced336888ae5c49e4e65b0351	the food at this bar is cheap and delicious.  and to top it off, the service is fast.
ade5736c64e7591b9b37a9aba24da11328ebfc0acfed615796877d2f099f7fc5	good mixed drinks, the best cocktails i have found in the scottsdale area and their craft brews are great!
bc1b31d56040bab1e26cf65d4971e502e05ca34df14dc16f23c480c72b2c1e64	best cheeseburgers ever... i didn't even know this bar existed until this past weekend. their cheeseburgers are amazing. i usually don't eat fries because it's bad for you and overly fatty. but their onion rings are extremely tasty and so so good. i will definitely be returning soon.
9d32b9b4c14e0012f4149bbb4a8521421bd0d47c7a75776343c732c8b7e63b1e	nothing overwhelming here - seems pretty generic. reisling white wine was passable but i have had better. was more french (bordeaux, champagne) wine than californian.
521026b566c3bd0b028191e13026860aa2a9060952711f736edfc86f26fe5f49	tried their martini. not a fan of their mixed drinks, and their craft beers were meh. the wine selection was terrible.
b49b1ca5995fd7de6492f6e9378106471f78aa6248c4271b319962ec4c9e8ffe	cosmos were delicious. tried the margharita, old fashioned, and mojito. came with mint and a salted rim.
445907a6eaf1f0fcc6042415d822d2fa84d67c0d3cfcbeff5716333f0cdab1fc	we waited over an hour for our drinks when the restaurant was only halfway full!! other tables were served their onion rings that came in a whole 20 minutes after us. the hot fries were warm at best and tasted frozen. it was a terrible experience for what we paid and we will never be back.
84f7eba29329c7d9bd3263bffb58bdd269fbfd9bb419a95a2e7d3494d908d1e0	how does this place not have 5 stars? it's open til 3am, has amazing bbq. there's like no one ever sitting at the bar when i've been. rib and burger portions are big and drinks are cheap. always clean. pick a song from an old school jukebox while you wait on your drink at bar. heard a customer ask one of the gorgeous waitresses if they could have her number and she happily gave it. haven't had a bad experience yet.
f2c4ae3d13f0e85f243051719853ef37e8bb9fba4df1263c40a94294747604dc	this is my ipa, martini heaven. it is a warm, inviting hole in the wall.
fc204c0fe7fcfa2b4070c2f04c028ec170a9ee754cda3ef1ab08b4fb2a429684	it's a bar.... same mixed drinks served a dz different ways. still one of the only beer and wine places worth going to for alcohol
47b1746450bdf1a1bcd5a6cf573f1346e735a3b30130eca4254056e2fa0893db	one of the worst bars i've ever visited. the ipa was so weak and flavorless. the option was local or imported. i got the local, and it tasted like water. the sangria lacked flavor and too sweet. the appetizers, which are nachos are way too salty. as weak as the imported beers are, at least they had some flavor...
a61ff65331f0562826cf4b94c2468fe857725efea926b5d465fc81f9c6ea4056	you should only venture here if you are looking to drink the best bloody mary in town! seriously! i though i though i had died and gone to heaven. the onion rings were also enjoyable as were the cheese fries but oh man you've got to try their bloody mary! my friends and i went on a tuesday night around 5 and walked right in.
e5761c5b709fe47132ae564c4f454854cd68de1a089c02b26c3464fa5061de4e	tons of hot chicks. drinks and food are cheap. cheaper than hooters or chilis. if you new in town this is the place.
65f2f2cdc26a1551762620820308f0f4c6d9f6588834945973a18eaeca18c73f	i had an absolutely fantastic german lager here, and the sauce for the buffalo wings.... wow, just outstanding!
31a09715c535bc114ad1c9bd5c7ecd7fbb9708a2e2a1bc66d2eda70bf195d152	great steak choices and they have healthy chicken treats for dogs too. their breadsticks also rock, and their wine is to die for! thanks for being a great grill and for being dog friendly.
dfa475052ba0db8667c6cb9ee5c743663a4a2f25b5d65cc481b1884890b290b5	ipas are awesome... service is lacking with one bartender working, a bit slow and inefficient. waited 30 min for my beer.
e962d742a062dd6e0f654a59d7f9d20bbb80ca3deb4368bbe8552822a4ee3109	thanks yelpers for the suggestion, in town for a few days and looking for a place to get my chicken fix, this place really was everything i could have dreamed of, and the bar was stocked well and the selection of drinks, beer, root beer, soda, and even great wine!
839f785fbd8274fcf4a0474644ce681d08c6c355beb39c355dd7328ef1506d0f	love the peanuts and beer!! service is fast! my friends and i drink & eat here all the time!
3a3c0c80e715d36d90f864bd89856a08fd1a9f04a8e098c5ae139dcce568c6e0	average tasting cheeseticks. not enough cheese relative to the amount of breading that encases it. i think that the overdone breading amount takes away from the cheesestick as a whole. however, i must say that i love the look of the jalepenos poppers.
0bb20b38494500d22eca56dd78091d78c4b179ca186405b031c6a32242ae5609	when i want to have "all-you-can-eat" fries, i always come here! the fries are always fresh and so delish! not only do they serve all types of fries, they also serve a variety of snacks like "pretzels, homemade chips, chicken wings and more! if you want to go when there's not a lot of people, you should definitely go during dinner time although there are more variety of beer and fries during lunch time!
aa9612b72ddf84162abbfb12e635080e8e641074832b935c0ba4d14b91dad8b0	i've dined at izzy's cantina several times and i am always impressed. i usually get the amazing margaritas. has a good menu selection, always friendly bar staff. often has live music that doesn't overwhelm your conversation. great bar food at a reasonable price. it's within close distance from my house and i usually enjoy a ride on my beach cruiser to get a great burger and cold frosty beer. thank you izzy's cantina. i will drink here often.
45898660267c555c4fca05c26f86158721c7b70ac623d9619f978a11e3b32b7b	excellent american bar food, great burger variety for all tastes, the cheesesteak is unique and flavorfull, toni and his bar staff are pleasant and diligent, clean and drinker friendly place with tasty flavor, we will be back for sure!
b4e8e09abdc17abce32d76dd5142d5d4e65d76c463ee2c9cc90e90da72984cf0	i think this is the best wine selection in arizona!!! i go to other bars looking for fine wines all the time so i have had some great french wines and i think the french merlot is just as good if not better than the other red wines.
b0a434d0a9aafb772d4aecb87cc22406501044136b2faae83a599fd07e81c74a	i tried this bar on march 2015. i ordered the cosmopolitan and it was a very good drink basically it had no good alcohol at all and lots of sugar. i don't recommend this bar to any one.
f576374c74252475f4a1e08da5b52bdecac7c4b025c3942fe489e5e46b959a83	the buffalo wings and german lager i got was the bomb!! vinny is an awesome bartender/chef/doorman, or whatever he is.
ca34ee1eb9c89cc938ca386c281fbcbb80f008b9747fdd75758655d75960bc35	what an awesome place! i had their local ipa and loved it! their table sauce for the wings appetizers was so amazing, i wanted to buy some. the chicken fingers were even better! the family who owns it (the staff) were so great!
d8a542ff04e1e25c56e850c1d47e4f5f5b467606dd3a03906030fd279199314b	what a neat concept. a bar located at the ford car dealership. the food was amazing. definitely will be back on our next trip to vegas.
ecaea27d70d6ff7e6fa10880b2ab12c30202eda6461a1743d575069b133e137f	we stopped in on a whim. the bourbon had a bite to it so when i ordered the 1st two shots i was really looking forward to it. i started getting sick right away, so i switched to beer and was really disappointed in the pretzels which were tasteless. bur the service was great and everyone was very friendly
5ba940eff04e901d2fa4bd340be8a0aff2c32b79281ecf18a31708730106f180	some of the best draft bear ever, not to mention the wine selection. there was many tequila shots to pick from and tons of malt liquor. you have to try it!
739e868558473250cb5530f7bf9befa1ea840dcf7bf18c54f7507e2395e386a5	i'm surprised i haven't written a review for this wine and mixed drink place yet. my favorite wine and liquor spot in the city. i ordered the typical merlot and cabernet so not much to report except that their variety of wines meets my expectations. of course, merlot in france is better but, you really only have two or three good wine bars in toronto that are close enough.
b8b56d2dcaf18b9777b3dd95009c77b46d7f932847aed7be500dc2b76c0cc0e7	delicious is what i would say. i got a local ipa and a small shrimp appetizer. it's near the mall entrance and the food looked so tasty that we had people come over and ask about it! loved it: -)
003bb0623b0d5b531526f7335b64d76413e3ff62669fdc257285c7081e5bdbf1	i love, love, love this place for its beers on draft. four of us went and each tried a different ipa and had a fabulous time. their local beers are amazing.
7b56a55fe3b7427575063d5b267a1a814f391c0314df5415559222a4a60f0d09	love this bar. just took down the cheeseburger and some fries, always good no matter what time.
667c8810711af3f57b62d23c800124a3dae8793e78ff1f5efb85a9b04dbd6928	went to fatboy's bar to get a turkey burger and beer today and it was pretty good & the price $2.99 was even better.... also had the nachos which were also a big platter & cost $2.99... overall i had a good experience & i will return to try something else from their drink menu. their bartenders were nice too which i wasn't expecting.
7838cf1cf0e61a3b46c96acc2cfad4b226c1c45d76a511ab145500b15e304f05	nice little bar. it had quite a variety of beers and wines. the bartenders working there were nice. i had the mango martini. it was very good, and i will definitely go back, too bad it's far from home.
32c7fddb7c8c24b477bde7bb3e36698b64f59dad81d1b5dc04585fa23d306e12	excellent food, drinks, service, price and atmosphere. definitely coming back for happy hour for beers and appetizers.
36f09a0b37cfad73a23f22a15ab630a5b85e47dbdc26fd14c56187e69c1de31a	loved the frozen margaritas. my husband said the burgers were the best he's ever had.
1df88136e238ee14e3ca13e0eac3190fbc5202f4b27c974f9144aa7b6a6407d4	the best wine bar place, hands down! they always have a variety of different wines that changes often. i personally love the red wine merlot from france! they have a great selection of foods that go with wine too, like craft cheese. then, when you are ready to check out, you spend a lot less than any other wine location. at competitors you can end up paying $10 a person for a wine tasting! at menchies, you spend $5- $6 less for a wine tasting that includes red and white wines! the staff has always been friendly and tolerate children well. my family and i love this place to try reisling white wine and red wines from france!!
128d213108d20abad2a688772be9f7f42a30894c87dc7748049c3310245edb6c	this is my local sports bar and also my favorite, i know it may not be the gourmet wine and beer but it's a guilty pleasure that i can't stray from. and at this spot, it's always clean and has friendly staff. they seem to rpepare my drinks just the way i like it compared to other bars.
63e45064284ccb5f9ea1feba7176a1f3e6db2d2c5040727124f5432eb0f96006	excellent happy hour prices... amazing beers...  super clean... fast service... open late. what more could you want?  had the fulton craft beers.  soooo good.
0d8476ada3a214c9fb85a86ebf9c461045231b9922c0f0c3e9f424956797fc4b	after moving to the north phoenix area, the bar and grill has quickly become one of our favorite spots to go for a quick beer or even dinner. great assortment of bar foods and drinks. we've only tried the bbq ribs so far and they are definitely above average for the most part, if not just a tad pricey, but more-or-less in line for that type of bar food. service has been great so far and the outside bar area is quite a relaxing place to hangout and night with out being overwhelmed by typical bar crowds.
4fe2ba4d8fafdefb080d1e84cd2d93059fca2537da2c514e814ec7d13b4f3df3	love the shack bar anywhere. this is honestly a almost 5. florida is a better place. staff is awesome and beer is good
081a61b2b6932bd95edcd70dfb0fe0324610793bc2527d3913e1311b9411afc2	pleasant clean friendly staff and the wines are amazing!!! my friend got the rum with a lemon!! the whiskey is strong.
74b1dc5046cd1acfc6f1ad527734e02a6fce31b6609d5d36a25fc0f349d26507	get your draft beer and toasted sub here at this pub instead of dealing with the potheads at the bar next door. they taste better and there is actually room to sit.
ab10b3a7c53f5a2d57210c572ea59b297ed7f18d6e09d721fbd80bc744ebf126	such a nice place  to have drinks if you are on a budget. the service is great and fast and the servers are very nice and helpful in their suggestions of what to drink.
f633fb3d72d2df931d265e1cb80d52108b72eeb8f528b8e9734c0faaf5359ea6	if i lived in the area i would always be a regular patron here when i want to wind down with some cold drinks. there's a great beer selection (the german ginger ale was particularly outstanding), and it has a nice club feel. it's also the only bar and grill so far i've been in that has decent dining space. one deterrent would be that there's one long straight frickin drive from richmond hill along yonge st. to get here, though i can't let that cloud my judgment. this place is easily up there with the best bars in gta.
452d9ac90e5be0c1e9539c9af0c2a5c566d9d9782d014570295a35e7e34c3453	this bar had the worst buffalo wings and fried onion rings i ever ate. the chicken skin was very hard and must have been cooked and stored for several days before breading it and frying it. the beer wasn't cold either and the wine selection was limited. i won't be going back to this bar and grill.
44402b04791b3fdb764c38ee67a88cf20967c4204d3ab5e42a82ac56dc6dedb8	we used to go to china red cafe, until we tried this bar- their bar had sake from japan, riesling white wine from germany, red wine merlot from france, selection of beer on tap if you are really hungry add a pretzel mix, chicken wings, and a selection of fine cheeses all for only $3 more yum!!!!
9500804c18c9739ed57e3e0054f951a8667f59a2607fa279978a2831bfa8870d	best ipas ever! the beer is amazing - just like back home! i love the beers they have on draft as well as their mixed drinks. i used to exclusively patron a different bar but this place has a bigger beer selection and it's incredible! if you want inexpensive local beers then this is your place! love the little chips they give you during happy hour as a free appetizer. closed on monday's so keep that in mind. enjoy!
9f8bad7fba97be9c0befda2a769fa95f00968dc8b4bf44935d1f404f36ac6e59	bar food is pretty good here. i went here for the first time because my usual bar had a horribly long wait. i have had one of the philly cheese steak sandwiches here and the curly fries. sandwich was good, fries are excellent. if you are looking for a place to go out for drinks and comfort food, then this is a good bar to try out.
700b12cf24f54764b374a269711fbe656cbd54cc6e6da1cc277e5fd71ac0008d	have been to this restaurant with friends since 2008. they have the most authentic and delicious wine in the town. their soup is amazing, even better if you make it a combo with garlic bread. red wine is always our comfort drink. their fries are also great.
ed1729cd19c3eb4b98a38a380098c6775acbace22157f8bd989b86ca19c88e91	found a new local ipa / microbrewery place! the bartenders know their stuff and will tell you about it, lots of variety for beers and the option to get mixed drinks if you prefer.
f4384c803abd6b9cfb9f6e5cbddfb63381e55cfc89a063fa02e58f643fb0fd72	bad mixed drinks and bad bartenders. i keep saying i'll never order liquor at this bar again but in phoenix there's not much choice if you want cocktails.
f4e566787112463aac363c7aea789b8960c12ce2dfd7e24308d40a1cfae58a5b	ok... so it's in a strip mall and it resembles a hospital cafeteria... the food however does not reflect the surroundings! it's delicious! seriously! the biggest cheeseburger in the u.s. and one of the most delicious. the ingredients are fresh and perfectly prepared. this isn't your poor version, this is the authentic american bar food version. go here... eat more!
ddc274ab80f26b098bb2892cc905f7ba3f124134f4ac45d281c4ccffb28c3f9b	the drinks and hors d'oeuvre were delicious! i ordered the tapas sampler, which came with a calamari. and my spanish omelette was cooked to perfection. pricey, but worth it. would definitely go back.s
a105c874f6304ce2a4f7fa6f822bd4797a1baf7bc3f292365aa182d523f19b75	this place is truly a 5 star place in quality buffalo wings and garlic fries!. they have the best wing flavors in town, it beats rudy's. this is authentic bar food. the owner serves and cooks the food himself. as a tip, come in for lunch before 11 am for a discounted price on the buffalo wings!
d8470e336a0fc477982a8fa8970d573d28d7106e65d28fd1cefae3956f7ee15f	the bar has some of the best cheeseburgers around. go on a saturday night and chances are you'll have to wait for a seat but it's well worth it!
6754c01d408a238b0bcd5d8dd470f5e394b1152fecafed981587f6dc44823c41	this is a really good craft beer and wine place. i recommend coming during the happy hour because is almost no wait! gotta try the onion rings, that is the best dish in here! also better know a little about ipa beers and their wine selection because they are all worth trying.
601d8f997e19a41a57be0f203b6369cecba0c1360da673a60a6328e38a9f4795	bar louie a go go is pretty good for after hours. they have a wonderful slider. its the size of a hub cap and i order it with extra fresh onions. the spinach and artichoke dip is pretty good too. its fresh spinach with artichoke served over melted cheese. the best things about bar louie are the fresh popcorn on every table and the fresh beers. i honestly dont care for their lunch menu at all. but after hours is what its all about there.
3c1468d2051d4f8cd43ae2176795960fe79c8ec29d5bbbbc8bd938b44df97e7d	i love this wine bar!! the bartenders here are always upbeat and knowledgeable about their selection of wine, plus they make awesome cocktails.
616d7d394e0fc753bbdc65b4ff827c755bc0349a96dc933d59425b3fa3025f8f	this was my first visit to a gastropub joint, and i wasn't disappointed! my friend took me here for lunch and i ordered the pina colada and spicy buffalo wings . yummy!!! the pina colada was fruity and had just the right amount of kick to it! the buffalo wings were juicy and spicy, but not anything spectacular. i ordered the glass of alcohol and i should have went with just the shot! i started feeling drunk after only one glass of the pina colada, next time i will only have 1 shot.... anyway, a great place for a some alcohol and snacks!
d8a4a2446af6f0332dfd42175019551d65b1b07459afe03d88e1ab13f016eb29	the cranberry vodka cocktail i had is the sole reason why i give this bar 5 stars. otherwise..... it's overwhelming in that bar man.
27a41d443ace123a7e612799c715422609f8d791e7a8057b1c828137a55aab40	i haven't been here for awhile since i've moved across town, but this still stands as my bar and grill in phoenix. my favorite items are the chicken wings, cheeseburgers and * the best * shepards pie. large portions, excellent quality. it was always very affordable, the happy hour specials in particular.
760d81c3214b6bbe039dec3841ca00fa5f475a906d6ce2cc0221c23102925789	i'm a fan, beer and food comes to 28 dollars. good food, mediocre service though. me and my girl eat and drink here pretty often when we need a beer and chips fix. i also like the bbq ribs, the cheese sticks and the salsa. they recently changed up the menu a bit.
83251f4b2197a62e088b7a87d3e5c6b52e5f0b73ee21932e6a16ec6050078e38	the beer is great and the wine too! nice selection of bar snacks. i always bring friends here and they love it. my go-to bar for happy hour.
99999f21f1235293e49f74531e08bec4659f53f7eb3c471d48a8ca02d1748559	i had the buffalo wings and fried mozzarella sticks and both were great. my girlfriend liked them as so everyone was happy, well fed, and they were a great compliment to the refreshing wine coolers and german lagers we had too.
fa4af4695cb2126989a0021c03de491a6304fff41e03be9e7113b1ec1c046d11	hands down the best selection of wines in vegas. everything i've tried so far is amazing, love the french reds, argentinian whites, californian wines, you name it! since they're the best, they're always busy serving fine wines!
c04fd0e59cd2072ea25146c0f8c6a7e44a37a93c00107847c68111b8d42b596e	we love this cocktail bar! delicious martinis, not watered down, friendly bartenders, and many other mixed drinks! what more do you need?
bbb878a78706313a612f762e45cd5d710a4426a965f3a86573cb1d40d466e383	i would go to las vegas just to eat here. amazing food. great service. 100 percent american. i love bar food!
1e124a77f68844e524e4ef57e329c0a4581c02318548d4749ee3373988269aaa	what can i say about their drinks? been coming here since they first started serving brews in the late 80's. best ipa selection anywhere!! great mixed drinks and cocktails. their onion rings and hot wings are outstanding. this has been a favorite place for my friends for years. my 2 friends still say their favorite drinks are the martini's and french red wines!
1407e9dc251261e3f08a6cc0bec794af41a20e2cae38f62e023523fb9052fb26	happy hour prices are really good i always get chicken wings and fries with onion rings. always done the same. cant go wrong with with this happy hour. quiet little bar with like 5 tables
529e91502d35c020e9ad6fdac44d6ebaa39e5d0d73bf7243381ad22b3fea7114	loved the cucumber martini. the potato wedges weren't what i expected. tried several drinks and they all tasted sweet. i will probably come back next time but forget the draft beer. not worth $8 bucks
03b3dfe526402e2e2d2015af81e1eacdaeeec760d04efd1c8e92cd4fa890504e	best nachos in vegas in my opinion, and i've lived in mexico for 6 1 / 2 years. i prefer it over the other popular spot on the strip, hands down. jalapenos and sour cream always included, you don't have to pay extra. burgers are cooked to perfection. i recommend the chicken wings. it always hits the spot.
82a0985ae13dbeadef2a3a87af3d3f23a0d73699984daa52993d3fc5842346a5	i love bar food and craft beers. but today when i got my onion rings, hot wings, and craft beer, the rings were stale and cold, completely salty, and the beer didn't even have any foam to it. worst brews and onion rings ever. how can they sell brews and food like that?! take some pride in the fermented drinks and food you give your customers. if you know it isn't fresh and the beers are old, fix it. don't sell it anyway.
0bfe30e9219c8b8ff6512cc1308ad11d705d370d07922268b5ed0c07959339c1	i ordered the steak fingers with cream gravy. fingers were small but delicious. the gravy and fries with the meal were tasty. i tried two of the three dipping sauces and both were excellent. i'll definitely return for more food and beer.
bc7c1c627b7ed9d909b6f2f220229d5fa47cb9f2706f4d37ff55d36d4c2a4c14	this bar is probably the nicest i've seen and super clean =] and the chicken wings are great! i love the cheese sticks and irish coffee!
8137ad482df303e54d5c1189b9e36ebf994745a7b90f4b1e0c11940362f0ec10	amazing! the fried calamari is bomb, and comes with free tartar sauce and salsa! have tried the draft ipa, lager, and pilsner so far soooooo good!
1083954ff39583818b5ff26e906bd7f808b21b34ee9f22cda09c2164ffa7da21	beer menu extends beyond a simple bottle of budlight. what was a poor man's beer with some sprinkle lime, this you will not see here at loui bar. this bar has really delicious concoction to bring a cup of regular beer to level heaven. if beer isnt your thing then there are some wings, barbecue and some hot dogs. you will be so surprised by choices. portions are huge so be ready and come hungry.
d7c409d2c1b7e889f2954e391fa72f0118106798f20593575f3a0fa2b4ca728a	looking for a raw yet fabulous sliders. mozeralla sticks and nachos are as delicious as any other sliders. top off your meal with a great wine! if booby's burget palace was in st. louis this would be my favorite bar when craving a burger.
6b79842a1811dd776ca4009347df1660d6f9783b07a4ac6c20c7bdde295eef5b	this is my absolute favorite bar food place. and trust me, i've been to my fair share of bars. they rotate their beers regularly to go along with seasons and they have the biggest selection of greasy foods that are always hot and delicious, might i add. the place itself is decorated really cool and the bartenders are always friendly. way more side choices than any other bars. i love this place and frequent it, can't say enough good things!!!
81551e204af75df9cfa39896ad0910e7c8ce5ff3b23fb525499133a793ee3a9b	the ipas were absolutely incredible and the fried shrimp appetizer was the bomb. my only criticism was that the appetizer portion was huge!
f814862aa2b0aa1d6253e1a0fd1f2f9c3cedd565e9650f19b300a1d1c1cdf063	excellent food and cold drinks. the artisan burger was very tasty and the hot wings were spicy and flavorful.
807f0b4112c380e0edd06b6d5dd51c5e139d0d247823828843bfc1bba22cd88f	ok, i didn't retry the chicken fingers yet, which got a bad review, but i'm trying other bar favorites on menu. today, cheese sticks with marinara. delicious!! and it was a healthy portion. flat bread, which ruins a lot of flat bread pizzas if not good, was warm, soft, toasted, and moist. i would definitely eat again and recommend for anyone looking to have a good appetizer.
8ea46006ce3c08f874b74e7ed7cde6218e980541ad66350e665f2dc50a535805	their specialty house white wines were great! we had white wine resiling from france. plus some non alcoholic wine for the kids. not too sweet, not too bitter. it was great.
bc24ae1fa93ad38490484b46d06c44a71cc8360685a45eed08bb67bad74d1c15	clean little bar across from the hard rock hotel. i'm always on the look out for cheap bar food like cheese sticks and beer & this place definitely delivered! the bbq ribs are awesome too!
d1f4d29fad52ad14e59c01a328563ac587d06dc7776a5e3a5a1f63f373657d10	awesome service, amazing flavors! i got the cheeseburger and the fries and it was absolutely delish!!! the american lady server i think is the owner or manager she was super friendly she even packed me the ketchup for my fries i had to order one onion ring it was that yummy! yes my tummy is much satisfied
7b80ca4780fee4259eeb6a471e482a58ab69a5d0ff3ff74be0e8b81669750c0b	mixed drinks. cold draft beer. the only two items you will need to ever order here. every time i come home i stop by here. do yourself a favor and stop on by.
47abf007210a5e1fec8cc9f68ce4bb73114f5fe02958c19e9a55659be5e169c2	$15 for a cheap draft beer and cold, stale onion rings.. and the bartender made me wait 15 minutes for a mixed drink. no thanks. don't waste your money on their boring brews.
75d9347df93549156d5de9681945cb05b4b6c744f12de292d0c2df8e2b97bc1b	warm inviting atmosphere, excellent mixed drinks. i recommend the amazing manhattans.
91fb800b44edec2a7894eb129e13a57b7d1fcc2725fbcc42d675364f25371cb1	yummy onion rings here and a wide selection of drinks like wines and lagers! the buffalo wings are very juicy and the prices are low, so it is nice to grab a couple wings at a decent cost when i'm hungry after drinking. the bartenders and waitresses were very helpful and polite, and i felt very welcome.
0b8f975b54c5dbce0d6178478be807b899867217cde064f7bb2538fa0279ba12	excellent bar food and drinks in a down home, welcoming drinking spot. very good bloody marys and chicken wings at a fair price. will definitely return.
ba9e65d8bcf625a2ae0dabb96c3b7571d2995c31621682513a68f39e3a63dc94	the bartenders were terrific to work with and even made one alcohol free drink for a friend at my brother's birthday party. the peach martini flavor is amazing! they are now my go to place for a couple of drinks!
33a37505e26d546de4c979ea5f939d0866944da505a19a59a3a5120b64c5e03e	love this craft beer spot. the mixed drinks taste great and are not watered down like other places. their wine list is diverse and go well with the oysters served. bartenders are very friendly and there's indoor and outdoor seating.
cd9a4f421a26b5373d5490bd68d42af11b2661ebe150e45420d6f8c3a99aa2c7	this is a very good place in downtown montreal to get some drinks and snacks.  just about everything is made with high quality ingredients.  you can't go wrong with one of the drink and fry combos.  and the choice of natural snacks as well is great.  this is definitely a great place to either pop in and grab something and sit inside or hang out on the outside terrace and watch the people on the streets while having a really tasty not so bad for you treat.
ee30f058fcfcd46817b0e43e78c19e6fdd894ad011098070eeaea67d29284a70	awesome restaurant. really great mozzarella sticks, bacon burger was amazing, tater tots were to die for. even the music is calming: you have to try their french fries as well... this is the only truly good burger joint we have in the city i have enjoy everything so far.
6d9cff39a63d63d1059c53d266dbe6b3e54e8dbff93ee1cd627e7bcd205e3b8b	best white wine riesling!! very flowery nose, sweet and sparkling, almost like white wine i found in germany. with some nice legs when the glass was swirled. i'm not a white wine drinker but this one makes me feel like i want to go back again! not that impressed by bakeries, compared with wine bars.
9dc45c2cb2e1f33a536524355569dba77227234f2c2556d6e9c0d833a77d5fbb	omg this bungalo bar closes 10 mins early!!! why!???? we were in the parking lot (with our taxi, btw) and the lights turned off and no staff was around and it was 10:50pm!!! grrrrr!!! this is so dumb!!!
26592eae744e87a6f6ea55b4e46378ebda54ef02519bee94968e6ddb58e2b3b9	my new bar hangout! the craft beer was fresh and delicious, bar was clean and cute, the pretzels are life!!!

d6fe4d590f9f404873ef0665abe1e98879fb8fd88e14aa77dbf62169653809ba	ok, you need to know this isn't a pub!  it's a tap room / craft beer place.  pale ale was the absolute best i've had.  hoppy and flavorful.  if you're up for something other than mixed drinks / shots give this a try, it won't disappoint.
f9651ff9239f7596615a96fcf880bb5596c5bba9a4205a84a1e7c4f602bd6023	this was my first time at outback, but it will not be my last. the lighting as incredible and the food was excellent. the presentation was amazing! i highly suggest coming here at night for the grilled steak, you should also try their curly fries and draft beer. i hear their soup menu is also divine
56e975ae2846dee69bd6ae41b6b73ac5dca0a87e7e6232f8a46c671184ad4d0c	i got one of the best fried onion ring and buffalo wing combinations i've ever had here. i was pleasantly surprised and the lagers were great too. it was cheaper and better than glory days.
5e0ef6807760a24442ecdf320931fe02772e41fd26558fe6ab49e07ba75ba170	i gave it 4 stars because the atmosphere was great for our party of 6. the service was very good and the place is cool. the onion rings were the highlight. everyone in my party said their cheeseburgers were top notch although the fries were disappointing.
1f9065f25a7114366fa464b00cd6225e98c24449b262f99623e12904209a1200	i ordered the pale ale. it was alright. the bacon wrapped mini appetizer was incredible. overall, it was a great experience and the price was reasonable. the owner could easily have jacked the prices due to the bar's reputation but he doesn't and i can respect him a lot for that.
a3b895c22d82b02faf3f27e26fff01b4a2cb378d9aaeb543c2a5bfbc2cb140a9	this my fix when i want cheap and easy bar food quick! open 24 hours, so if your hungry and leaving the club in scottsdale its nothing to take a cab down the street and get a sandwich from this spot i have only tried the blt sandwich and the fried chicken sandwich. both are delicious.. cant go wrong with 24 hr bar food especially this spot

ab8e60663c91567cd37e0a448506e1244b950266f9283c641cb5dad915f01c60	aboslutely bomb beer menu. the onions rings are ok, but not as good as their house cut french fries. it might be the best beer i've had in the east side area for this price.
eb28c1339ded2bc646a2e9186092cbee3a6393b08f7f3b37212dba1123d1f347	best bar in town if you're from new mexico or have ever enjoyed a frothy lager or full bodied pale ale. if you're not familiar with this type of craft beer i would still suggest trying it out along with the beer on tap. real tasty brews, not too hoppy, nm budweiser!!!!
2f78ac6384b0880444b13fac714ac20ea3f8f515b390fe05f95d308f33a311f3	awesome mixed drinks. just like the cocktails i had in piura years ago. wife had a vodka and cranberry and i had the mojito. both were fantastic. try the old fashioned, it was remarkable.
99ce5d14d7266f498f747072de1387206c2d4a9288c13d52b43e533019f052e1	joe's grill never disappoints. their bar fare is always so fresh and gives a "homemade" feel to the typical bar fare and drinks. i came with my family and my daughter threw her cheesesticks on the floor! they did not hesitate to make her a new batch and replace them even though it was almost closing time! we were really impressed with the management and the service.
fc587795cdface6456862e305a03e6d734d6ba129849d1d234d83d208352771f	i've been here twice and had shots (whiskey and vodka) and beers (surly furious and summit epa-i think).  service from the bartenders was good the first time and great the second time.

41bef3129ab36b9518d37db423ce7420efc0c92238e884a41a680a9147678e49	we had the pale ales, a merlot and some oysters. all were so very good! the bartender was very personable, and when he accidentally gave us a pinot noir instead of a merlot he gave us another drink free.  will be back!! best selection of beers and wines on the west side of town!! yum!
3217eeb25154fde069136ca8f9e0d2b4d3620dac4ed81d399f1cb068eaa72278	the drinks were really good and it was paired with great friendly service. my cherry cockail was just outstanding.

55a8f3361c1aa54871841e2205451977d87126fd8e57edb7e35465c9b9e940a8	just had my first bruschetta and onion ring combo from granny mac's... wow! step aside glory days, granny mac's is the king of bar food and drink.
b977b71f98fbce10373e307f947db47eea09fefb1e42f0992e3ed7c680b8036b	they really have great cheese sticks and a massive beer selection if you are into that. the cheese sticks are so delicious with this homemade ranch dipping sauce - it's also quite a large serving, my wife and i had to split it.
2fdb8c6c476221c8ac158b9d0a76019afc95bbfb959bab9464e354bccf804207	really bad, nachos were cold when they arrived. don't go there, not even if it is one dollar draft night.
9cb60b096e453411df8ece6eb3572197ac5f052684184419935ae507c48af12f	this place has the best onion rings ever, i love how they just melt in your mouth. they are open 24 hrs a day and have good, cold beer
f142429784fb79c28cb3874530e661f0a628ca6d465d938093a84293fbe647c7	spicy wings are filled with delicious creamy cheddar cheese and two hot american beauties. they have delish polish baked potatoes, and gourmet, homemade pasta. get the goose on the rocks because its freaking bomb

cd712b1651af227ce755335944e4d6cce14939a2cc5598eb0ebc2e312fb4ec94	i gave up on bars in vegas. even this place at first, but then was reintroduced to this place and it soon became the only place i'd go for draft beers. the onion rings are always on point here. fun atmosphere and the best ipa beers as well as wines! love the staff they are awesome, and so are their mixed cocktails too!
3b4813ed7359e56baec865fd53c29364a8ec173f1b824da4ccfb78135c30cdcd	still my favorite place for draft beers and burgers. try the johnny walker blue label
13665cd99ed181b3478af39d78f9c1b30190647674b87a05042d2473bd023bc4	their moscow mules and mojitos are really good. if you go on sunday for happy hour they also serve you onion rings and hot wings.
63570ef839877a45c54d6dd30bb9ce5a4a4f8d9f7e5cff12532ea4cdfbcf6a6e	this place serves up below average margaritas that are actually pretty bland but quite expensive. the salsa has no taste at all and the queso is lacking (the only time i've met a queso i didn't like so that's a bummer). they have onion rings which is pretty cool but i still would prefer to go somewhere else for food and drinks. sorry si senor but you have to try a little harder: (
fc12f62353288cdafceb52e4e8f216b15b068283d224eac84baf8395f90c416c	super friendly. joe the bartender was there greeting everyone, refilling our beers quickly and sharing how he uses local arizona suppliers. great bar food and decor too. loved the cheesesticks and bbq. will definitely go back.

38a7addf9956f054d36b95a3cd50259356bddb6ecf9fa4ae57fbe0f2eec59302	i've been here several times and have tried many of their drinks and must say the bar is probably one of the better drink bars in vegas. i highly recommend the cosmopolitan, margharita, mojito, and rum drinks. their drinks are delicious for the most part. definitely the place to find good drinks if you are on that part of the strip.
661f3ad3384255f91b0ba3427f6c209841b98e3c71641b05c529d09743e85e57	awesome service and delicious drinks. loved the loaded french fries. definitely will go back.
0a6a0e3992924659949cf0144701fa15ef8b9c16786d3ea3287c98df871c93bc	i thoroughly enjoyed the great drinks and generous pours at this bar.  the bloody marys are large with lots of different varieties, as well as martinis and rum drinks.  the beers were good, but not as flavorful as i would have liked.  but i would come back several more times to try all the other types of mixed drinks and beers they have on their menu.
2a6a45347399765dc8dd2d0d600fb3c843c80253538bef3d91daf89ff2d11397	great bar food for decent prices? yes please! expect a long wait at the bar if you go on the weekends. nothing fancy; just good, fresh bar food. loved my buffalo chicken wings with beer fries and ranch dressing, burger was okay.
e798a68df1dad454552c58f426eca262b72b196681cd19f3c078ea24138500bc	a clean, organic shop with good juice. smoothies that don't give you the sugar shock of milkshakes.
f90cb992bb31c7b0ec1731278c50f0fd38e5105976991f74c65ff1ad052c95cc	tasty craft beer and lunch spot. order the bacon burger.. was my favorite here. there is no wait if you get here before 9pm and sit at the bar. otherwise waits can be 15 to 30 minutes on weekends around 8pm when there is only one bartender working. french fries are fresh and salty and the house beer on tap is delicious. ill have to try the local craft brews next time.
86231fffc0ff7a24ee8edf05a9c450860462b76d72f35c81464de07066b70d71	fantastic!! this is a great sports bar. every time i go i get the fried pickles appetizer, but you pretty much cant find a bad appetizer or meal here.

e2e36cccc2982e1b245fb3749d63ab6fc995e4da00009f32c6757c3bd2ad2618	wine: large varietys of wine. the margeritas are also pretty big so you can easily share with 2 or 3 people. we had the chardonnay and merlot. i love their whiskey; mixer not necessary. service: we found seats at the bar immediately; no wait on a friday night. decor is 70-80s eclectic. the bartenders were very friendly and made great drinks.
8deb751aa4239ec5f99a609441657743465a8a5bbba163fd33780946c7019337	the sliders were awesome. it's simple and that is what makes it so great. you can't go wrong with the classics like cheese sticks. the food is always fresh and from what i've seen the bartenders enjoy working there. the nachos are good too..
2b0b05c04d53b52a0d56392ea8dbfd134cfff5e472ec9cb45be89fb450676603	the cocktails are great and the great selection of beers are delicious. the owner is the same guy who came up with the penguin menu. if you love the penguin, you will love pinky's!

79981ef6a312fc3fe1da2bef971b60ac1b5a59f1d685900e07ac37c95ef406a4	easily the best bar i've ever been to! 2 beers with meal for $7.50 is hard to beat for bar food (i'm looking at you chilis). i am going to take a nap after only eating the big nacho platter, i look forward to going back to the bar this evening. fantastic food, i will be back!
af2529fe493d0392c6b7bb497076f9093d0eacc16d1c19aae827ec6ab3e2b01e	my husband loved the cheese burger and wine and i got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes. the wine was delicious and the burgers were amazing. overall we would go back!!

d52fa92577873b8fc2b119092c4966d151fa008dde1518ba36607dbb630730f0	this big chain sports bar serves delicious chicken wings. the lunch specials are $16 which is a great; portions come in 8, 12, or 16 wings.the hot sauce and ranch was quite yummy; good wing flavor and good amount of spiciness. i like the hot wings and will definitely come back for more take out.

a3dd34dfe6899f77b79bc151dee63293af5e122934fac32cedcb18a659427fe0	unique bar for sure. not a fancy place, not a date place. but awesome options.... first of all, where else can you order pabst blue ribbon beer??? also, the mac and cheese sliders are amazing. i ordered the bacon cheese burger, and added to it a side of gravy fries. everything tastes exactly how i dreamnt it would. fattening and hearty! take home a slice of pepperoni pizza.... the best i have ever had anywhere hands down.

4f45380cf5156bb07f9e010b0a46e2f805cbff22004415abbb2264c9294040cf	this bar and grill is one of the best bar/ restaurants in the city. their loaded nachos and ipa beer is to die for.
530450b98fb99fbc4cc92434e450ff4e9b1a350c00006e5f8def126eeefb029d	one of the best bars i've been to! would recommend the red wine and the martinis. amazing ipa beers and the onion rings are on point.

f38bd7308c63749badb2114f2d35af05b1b5a8e412a8d68d2acd1eaea4e5f783	typical bar. i prefer this place over applebees any day because of their awesome-sized burgers and tasty chicken wings. however, i wish this franchise supported the military and offered a drink discount to the vets. cost to eat and drink there gets pricey w / my appetite, but still enjoyable to eat and drink once in a blue moon.
2362615929ed4c72fce90857a10a54523bf3f4cf01f69ef844c28bcdde57a4c7	we had green irish beer and enjoyed them.  very fresh beers.  service was slow but to be fair there was only one bartender working.  a quiet bar for those who like that.

77843073c2f6d6c0993679db350b3594b6ddf0468c772700cb54e1bfdf48335c	this review is pretty simple. juan's bar is straight up horrible. avoid this place at all costs and spend your money elsewhere. if you are in the mood for bar food i would recommend gadzooks it is close by and by far better than what you will get here!
749fa74177d5ac95bd0c5b668b5d97c53b871c4629269e65e37c8dc6217e0ee4	this location has the best food & service of any american bar food in vegas, imho. great job on the cooking & seasoning, i prefer it to other bars actually. the best cheeseburgers i've ever had anywhere. it's a smaller dining room and is always clean and the young man, steven, who brings you the food is attentive. very courteous staff and one of my fav places for bar food.
91d2eb8391900f4ab44009a11e8430caf86cc39eb7bd7ac9ea43842c54982ee4	cheap and delicious. cheeseburgers are cooked to order and you get your food quickly. delicious, though if you go all you're getting is a cheeseburger. so don't expect anything else.
a95ce6625ee7ed6ef1d2133c655da3706fa666cb1dc44e6c686bdb3b97e1e27a	we love harpers wine bar. i get the same glass of red wine merlot every time, and it is perfect every single time. great red wine varieties from france and california vineyards. the staff is exquisite!
e9caf044c18a0813cb74bfc3f1f2c74271a9b3de693d68c63dc391412832287a	by far, the best margaritas in town imo. patron tequila! so good! tons of other crazy tequilas, from don julio to casa nobles. you can't go wrong at this bar.
10ed208a317096a8a32fe67080adef0e80dbfe36e733876902657d8f20288578	i love bob evans, the bar has a fun and lively atmosphere feels that keeps us lingering long after we've finished our drinks. on this past visit i had a cherry and rum cocktail, a dark beer, and french fries on the side. my fries were served hot and it was very good. my husband enjoyed their house special combo which included 2 beers, a shot of whiskey, and a coconut cocktail. everything was to our liking and we will definitely go back to have a great time again.
0b118e0bc97a75efc985c153237b2913488eda6e33e7092a6c98c01d8a9d833d	a brewery that specializes in brews. who knew?! the ipa is amazing here. they were offering a special craft beer with onion rings and bruschetta the morning i went. i ordered a lager. it was amazing. next time i'll try something different, now that i know their brews are good. pros: amazing amber ale and porters.
f6a34f37e30637bb4e122c699ce639a98aea63679b62a3f4f9a1c583d4a51e3e	you can't go wrong with the wine list here. it has became a family tradition to celebrate birthdays with one of their fine vintages. this location is top notch. the staff working here are very friendly, the atmosphere is very relaxing, and it is very clean, and they are always getting in new vintages. a great place to spend the evening.
9f30339913905ac98d4134430b28e0dbe6c26102134df4ae52f3ee66483bfc77	my friend and i went to crimson bar while in miami for the weekend. it was right by our friend's house. our server was really cute and attentive. the fries were also good. i ordered cheese fries  and i was quite impressed. if you are staying at stonegate apartments in miami , give crimson bar a try.
3b6ad3b22ffb436771649f58d7d38650c297486340396b3564e9ff0dff4ad61b	real wine! i felt like i was somewhere in italy drinking there. they sell beer (the original cold pressed) and different type of fries. they also have better made wings.

bcd32b920a2b81a4e70ec63c8f1bac59a402af268cad5a6cbbc2e44d1bffce20	their homemade (i think) burgers are just soo good! i tried the bacon and cheese one. i firstly asked for the bacon separate to the burger, but he suggested to put it together. it was so crispy and soft. different from tom's burgers of course and so much better. you should come and try! their fries are just as good, and their steak? would kill for them. you can also try their chicken soup. it's wonderful also ask for some breadsticks
e6f1ddc03f1b7dc5ccd71c131c2ea73d8c00b6cb76c529c51070975fc867a17a	i frequent mimi's and i think the happy hour here is great! never have to remind the server that i don't eat burgers, usually order the pasta. and garlic bread along with some wine, this is my go to spot for happy hour! great wine selection as well, their soup is to die for
3e24bfb2d8d7a9b2355d65e1f60a031a661a330c581d1d29d2b5bbdb3ad4cd26	great cocktails! also they have an excellent wine list!! definitely will be coming back! thought the craft beers on tap was cool too!

8ec238f0c787498e05c5f91c9e8f1e808236e201d215854eccc44c2b3218b811	love rubio's! love love love their deep fried anything! my favorite is the potato wedges and hot wings! now, i am hungry!
3873fa02b13f06c7e8bf4d426f627eedaf20d2936954c431faaf61813a37da9e	i lived in san antonio for ten years and was never able to find a quality burger joint out here.... until i found carl's patties. hands down the best burgers you could dream of; maybe even better than those in san diego! they have bacon burgers, chili burgers, cheese, and ham burgers. their draft beer is also just sooooo good. you should also try out their beef steak, even their grilled salmon burgers are incredible
374719f3f336d98e9aca403cecf6a4452a07f215ac09601ac8482faeda767fce	it's an amazing place to eat hot wings! had the the honey mustard, ranch, blue cheese, teriyaki and barbecue sauces with my wings. one of the best little bars for hot wings. cooked when ordered and actually one of the best bar with wings in las vegas!
11d6b996bc3b361eb4ddb98ee2ceb09c0c2cd174946ae0e5fcbf12cc5ac0ff4f	their chili cheese fries are pretty good! we ordered beers that were not my favorite, but i normally wouldn't order those anyway. so i'll definitely be back to try more of their drinks and bar appetizers.
2756e88732d3142defe5f07094a8bd56681fcc6a1bf4b69dca9a9e9e574d1a0f	this bar has consistently great drinks, great food, and service at a good price.  there are no shortages of bars in the area, but my family and i keep ending up here as we all love the appetizers (and i can get a beer).  my kids love their cheese sticks and chicken wings.  oh, and the potato skins are to die for!
af2f9db7697cc49cbfb57f347f397e53560cd1b5fd0b26cd6c541ceaaa0c3a70	our family loves this bar. it's becoming a favorite saturday night treat for the adults. all of the fries we've ever tried are so crispy, hot and delicious! my favorite are the onion rings, they're the best! go! now!:)
efae231bb7779199248e50d14736d532d895df7ab6b2fa9b7d014e58696c9ee0	moved from the charlotte area from california and i'm still looking for a good cocktail lounge.  figured i'd give this place a try.  very nice bartenders and lots of variety in the drinks they offer.  i ordered a dry martini.  it was good, not great.  after a few sips though, there was the biggest cockroach i've ever seen crawling on the wall.
0511c751e45c3bca4994ea2bdeb3f1b3e23f910852d9793822e3f4147c1911b4	i'm visiting from la where there are no small bars like this... i was used to them from my time on the east coast and super excited to have some bar action again. i got a cheeseburger with everything and it was still mooing! i asked for my burger to be cooked more and i got major attitude. fail all around.
b5bbbbe972aea505efb48080f36ab79b6b4c105f894105121d52fc83aa6836bb	of the 100's of bar and grills i've been to over the years - including in new york - fusion 108 is one of the best i've ever had. the food is so flavorful and the owner is a very sweet woman. both the grilled chicken and the bread menus are really fantastic. the soups are large and the tastes are so amazing you'd die. highly recommended for eating in, also get as much garlic bread, and breadsticks as you can
b2bd9efeb946722e8ae27ec012237c084ae3c0a29ab9021d9c7fd40bc79bc4dc	walked in and was greeted right away by the friendly bartender. i ordered the local ipa made in the city. the bartender was really cool and let me try a couple other ipas from different microbreweries. i had the ipa from the next town over.
b2dafba35e8c38a23655f26b70fdbbc19b24ba67d3199d0a6963654f0cb17b8f	another downtown winner. if the best bars near me served the worst drinks on the night pub's list; i would go all the time.
1cb5df50179f868fa0c4e25fe71b4bf9bbd5c9f0ace093c3ef52675886724807	the service was very quick and my beer mug never went empty. they had awesome small plates, the bacon wrapped shrimp were killer. my husband had beer and said the ipa was awesome. also, the prices are great.
ab5253a57e77b624bf1fd028fe6d95dc544b74af4218f4597bfdcd80941c7db5	love this bar. i got the pulled pork hoagie, philly cheese steaks with onions and it was so good! the price and drinks are good and great location.
b58ff373dbb124ad250b9165c88d77239149ef79f9d77f8e581052db2d6758aa	you can not really go wrong with a margarita at pit stop. they are always fresh and well made, and they use top shelf liquor. we have also gotten their burgers a few times and enjoyed them as well.
cb0609321886716583b2c9439c5bf987b1bf4f1d9dd778cb03d8fd2e3392c8e0	one of the better bars i have eaten at. food is always good and great bartenders. if available ask for stuart as a bartender very friendly and helpful. also they give you a lot of food with what you order.
0cad66bc8b4c648f970bcc73d6ccbc0d3b04c43555b10f8146f4237523b07acb	very authentic brewery.  beers are made in house.  the owner was very nice to us.
59252fb740ac5a2a687b3323539f0a021ddc273dc2ad5e65e6899549529f8ff4	they have amazing wine. it felt like i was in new york city and not in pheonix. it's a very fun atmosphere! the best wine i have ever had in phoenix. you must get the out of this world bottle of wine!
089f1b5af14ada27bdca0c92d07ef41cca8a1346405932fcb41cd01ab4f2d488	we had a great experience at this bar, burger and beer was really tasty different than that other bar. i will be back to try the chicken wings on the menu
1e75f29c04376f2280992c50c9aa61e2ff586047339a088e719dcd25bfcdeda9	wow just discovered steaks r us it's godly! if you're adventurous try the grilled steak. and a little bit of beer went a long way. vegas love baby! also don't forget about their fried pickles and cheese fries as a side. their breadsticks were also incredible.
6695e788630f2a59ed73e471054c6818021a9b1d545cbe8401e47d350d27ad45	good craft brews, good wine selection, and fun mixed drinks. i recommend coming here with a hungry appetite for their hot wings if you don't want to drink their cocktails or martinis.
78723ebac797d0f6fdf13fa5b5bea5363725526840d9999c0a6b2189200e0062	i have not been able to buy drinks and bar snacks anywhere else since first noshing on the food at bob's.  nor can i drink any other beer, everything is just too delicious!  i'm actually picking up some potato skins tomorrow and i'm dreading having to avoid a nice cold one while i'm there.  true statement, it's a great place!
f909af0416cbbaadf36ff31d8e537e35cc813c7ac8e80cdd917e95aeca4f6bb1	not a fan. the grilled steak was ok, at best. and the bad thing was that they had cheap fish sticks and garlic bread for sale. ah, that's not okay. they need more chicken on the menu
95a8c5237fbd710314a892a1335b00dc4a65ba36cedc0dd4bddcbd855b3b548c	i have had one lager with hot wings here, a malt lager with a hint of mint. as a brewer, i can definitely say that the mint was mostly not fresh-not what i expected for the price..the hots were ok, but nothing special.
e6cc8036e7edb313c08ac543b297d77b5305919062e9fa2abe72fc27bdfdbe28	this is the east side location for this franchise of bar and grill. if you saw my review for the west side, then you know this is an amazing bar!!! yes, you can still be healthy and eat at a bar and grill. just get the ice tea, chicken wings, and a side salad, and you're all set to go. no vegas trip will be complete without my daily visits for the salad bar around lunch time!
387a082ccda1f583dabdc6a242808dd39e903c085d3d8508a118d36892caae5c	love the food and waitresses are bangin! i've been there 4 times already! the band plays 80s covers and beer is cheap!
ff1d33083c252a503f97b9e0f3395693a07c9791bc51f172da6169f9c9a05485	this place was pretty good! it reminds me of chicki and pete's. same layout and everything just a different name! the only thing i noticed is that it is a little pricey, but their crab fries are a good quality. so it's not bad if you're in the mood for bar food.
5a368d845db63a4d7ac8e8648f66b68fbf22a20f3a57ee97955b7b69bcd2d1a0	food and drinks here are amazing!! everything is so delicious and they are open 24 / 7! what?!? i can get some good bar food like nachos just for $1.50 and they are big too! the specialty drink are large and packed with flavor. all the bar tenders and staff are super friendly.
e5ec7a36d9e72573a4d4f7a7dbbaa2b787d12154bf97469febf1ceefe2bfa5e2	i have been drinking at this place for an eternity and i keep going back. it's got local, awesome beers and lots of choices. i usually get the ipa from the local brewery. i recommend trying this place if you're looking for a good bar.
8a378b6c3e0b7284015e15347eb39813dfe05316e75f9b162d08a84cbb1f34a0	bloody mary is great, as are most drinks here
136eee16375e228808cde8bf4accd8d48fb9dc1013d04ba0148021955b5bdc44	always a solid lunch / dinner spot for us.  all of the beer and wine i've gotten has been consistently fantastic.  and have you tried the red wine?
20af7cfae6c1a1e5cc4bd0efdcfc24e5e93a0c7ebdaeebdaf410dc76c6193418	ordered the cheeseburger and the patty melt. the beer was a little watered-down and tasted more of a cider. would recommend the hoppy beer over the sour.
88f33ac106824640e95fe730dfc1bb82def716b8f0d2a177e8f67ac96df9d9df	when ever i visit, i make it a point. to stop by archi's bar for a nice drink and good times. the bartenders never disappoint. when it's happy hour the place gets busy so be patient with the staff. the happy hour is also a great time for discounted drinks. the bar food isn't the perfect but it's great none the less.
22e3a31d9922bc3a6f24987549599bd8cae27a1fea62a39e2d91a27e9c8bf959	this bar is overrated!  i prefer the bar at aria, plus they have better appetizers - like their cheesesticks!
57f915d963fcd0fd67920bf012e39269899879de7bf1791f76f43be30a5baa96	an incredible approach was given, simple organization and a full set of emotions! their craft beers were very cheap and the service was great. our waitress was very friendly. we also had their beer battered chicken tenders and it was delicious. i had a dallas blonde beer and a few blood & honey beers. they were served in chilled glasses so the beer was extra cold. they had tons of great bar food to choose from, ranging between steaks, burgers and cheese fries.
7530ee341b5dec86bc29cd8aac51b3ce25f713614de7290d6ea3339ab332f153	huge wine and liquour menu. my girl prefers red wines so she was happy to see the list of french red wines that includes merlot and pinot noir. their moscow mules are delicious. the old fashioned is really good as is the long island iced tea.
7d9263e64f002819b68a892a54cee57d4c72be62c9072c96cfaa6ed98cc3ef1f	real pretzels. baked right. best bar food on the eastside! pretzels, chips & dip and appetizers are all good. must try!
165b727911946dfbb58a1a1366f5a98ee707423b79129a337da008d979f5df56	casanova bar has some of the best cocktails in the valley. the best cosmopolitans! no matter how busy it is, the bar owner will always greet you as you walk in to the bar and most likely remember your drink if not a newbie who needs suggestions for a cocktail. it's my go-to place for a drink.
c7d27beb99837506b6251f4eebd256c7735dac1e60d1f5af5c05043376e8150f	service was beyond compare!! food was yummy! we got the french fries as well as the mozzarella sticks and both were tasty!! the old red wine was intoxicating! could not ask for a better spot to stop before heading back to work.
3ae293bd963dff9fb8c7d36a4c9ea8ff851a916f2fa801f669e11b7db0b72808	i really like this bar. the drinks are great, especially the bloody marys. very fast friendly. cheeseburgers are good and the fries are fantastic. parking lot is clean as well as inside. i'm getting hungry for burgers as i write this review.
0acf145326cdab52b6a0e12c31ac2318c7918a6a21fe54d0a6ef1690aa6de26b	i didn't try the margarita, but i did have onion rings and a beer and they were ridiculously good. better than any i have had i'm a little verklempt
2f35891941b31472612a784891478054b3b8dc9f9db6c5bbbcd599cfa6c3f7c1	this is a good, delicious irish pub. we came here for breakfast and they give you a whole roast pig.. the staff was friendly and amazing customer service our waitress topped off our beers every 5 minutes. we will be coming back, thank you!
14c891910e261dfc5f8d5e5c3b37a905564cdc3b741b5c6d8f1306d10af4de4f	worst bar i've ever been to. the slowest bar i've ever been to, they jip you on the food too
8e66a1e865564d21f5096cb9b8e63139103b7016bbb7d9293c1d3ff2fce7d855	had my first red wine merlot from france and white wine from germany here & i'm officially hooked. the riesling white wine from germany is beyond delicious. they also had moscato and malbec. it's a little pricey for my usual taste but it is so worth it.  thanks michelle!
661a667248ed20dbce3ba8ea5264937f9abe2708ca0b41fe5381ee801fd982fc	i am not a wine cooler person but my grandma is and she loves the selection of wine coolers offered here. i loved the customer service behind the counter. i've been here a few times and they are always personable and friendly as they mix your drinks.
992b8bb159e39a4c87556f9261141de61e5db1f42d30a546a8863cbd5a5b01c6	i love this bar. i crave the craft beers and basket of fries too much. i recommend the blt for sandwich lovers! dining here is totally worth it! the service is great as well!
985208a9d0009d53626c45fbcaca89ef551c1306f6adfadd66a5f1b087fc10ec	gotta love a cheeseburger from a bar! never a line and the food is hot and juicy. lots of seating at the food court.
47cee8beb6d46dd52a234e34fb3c38717db08c6a3fe40a7f8f2c47eb58ce8937	friendly staff, great drafts on tap for a cheap price. nice environment with a great selection.
e0013e879990bd4fa8230e32a6186b52a3c5882773ae2b2fa8d6c96a70b966a0	i'm a regular for their soups, which are amazing! as well as their salmon rolls, but recently i stopped by for a family meal. their burgers were godly amounts better. it was a tad bit salty for my taste but the beef was on point. and their wine is cheap but great quality. don't forget to ask for their mozzarella sticks, they melt in your mouth. their grilled fish is also excellent, so don't pass that up.
540143e146d167dced6f4072d876af448958993d63a24217364cb9ca0fd390f0	very friendly and easy-going staff! loved the buffalo wings, the loaded potato skins, and the draft beer!
6788584b958092ddf39c282ba60e83a2acd1cea746f5a776f3f77d7c91fdfd4e	this is an authentic wine bar in mid-town phoenix. don't worry about selecting the wines, they have a sommelier so that you can relax while you savor the finest wines in the phoenix area. this is a lot like the wine bars to be found in wine country with plenty of choices. you'll also walk through their liquor area on the way in and out. lots of displays of authentic wine country goods.
02a0918f834aeec51a1ed5bfba973812562b5737779b0522eb0355855b5b408a	having been to the original location in ocean city, i'm displeased to see that the donuts here were disgusting. super rude staff and dirty facilities . if you like doughnuts and have never been to a fractured prune, just don't go. cold, gross, and run of the mill. dunkin donuts and krispy cream will always be better in this category than fractured prune. i don't see how this franchise is slowly growing it's locations across the us.
b3a296def3f9aa7081a3aa7cb17011391c5251c8df89df6a0a89b90c893bb3ed	love paletas betty!! great location & many types of wines. my favorite are the red wine merlot from france, and the white wine riesling from germany. my dog loves the craft cheese that they offer with the wine. stop by and support this local wine bar!!
f5029d2c3522e7e1a258f4c9e1ec4eeede96174bc3864c3af6c2005b1d810cbe	the onion rings and bruschetta here are always fresh and delicious and the staff is always friendly. i love their craft beers and their wine list.
63a04ea1cd9ee2f49ba84bb3d70bda5ff9985132586f50ae3c508cfddaffebcc	border bar and grill has always been my go to when i am in town looking for a place to relax at night, but this visit tops them all. ross, brandon, alan, and ciara helped me explore new drinks and snacks on the menu and wow i've been ordering the wrong things for years! i had the fried onion rings, chicken spicy buffalo wings and the shrimp poppers with a cold lager. all of them were amazing and so was the service, i'd recommend this place to everyone.
c945894b204d28f57941232bf71bfaa083009533d2aad15f1b2b5431d2f88add	i came here for happy hour a few weeks ago and had a good, cheap, cosmopolitan. $10 for a cosmopolitan and a long island iced tea...what a deal! the hot wings and onion rings were fresh and complimented the drinks well!
f0455851a4021be38030d6d9b506296f9a996dd8d8338ab10c872b09ea3a88ea	we absolutely loathe this diner with a passion! they offer the worst gyros around town. a big no thanks nicki for never taking care of us!
57ca2ab98375b70af9cd8f9e074b22b094f0143f63be0202e435c4a824faeeef	average drafts, average price. they do sell pitchers as well. nice stuff, quiet atmosphere, very clean space.
2db4d26c07246cbbb1da5195b60299c86b0a1bc520bb69a9b7af290e75df21a5	a great bar to visit when wing stop is too busy and you don't want to cook. want some bar food to eat while watching the football game? here's your secret spot. the burgers are delicious and the fries are crispy.
3578166c363cbb12b78ccb12825ce5e48cbb2039282f5d491ce41949bbdb340b	best drinks in vegas. they have games you can play while drinking their cocktails. always have a great time.
99552b2843865eb6a16b0b44632458fa1fb7ad635c5bb0504984e3a04d40222c	the best craft brew selection in town. their pale ales are truly a hidden gem!! their ipa is the best...all brews are full and delicious..each brew and craft beer has a unique and different taste. their beers are a must try...trust me!!
d3e65070e2be051641ac10ea0e7d0fe892ef9a1d18c15add1c161aaa094efaf8	really liked this place. they have the best craft beers in mesa. very foamy and not bitter and dry like most craft beer bars. 1.70 per glass or you can get a pint of beer for $16. i wish they could make a half pint for 2 people. other than that if you like pale ales and blonde ales this place is really good.
fefc92908ff76059949db15acb4a88245cbe5c4da6a232b13c47e93241047c11	this was our first visit here, greeted with a welcome to dillen's... followed up by a plate of steak, fries, and rum. we will definitely be back, great wine as well if that's your thing!
8c84dfe7da405d4ad7c842ce3276206cc298a5957affc35fbca4b2ce6b5ea7cc	love dragon express! superb service, clean bar and delicious wines that never disappoints! bonus that it's very close to our house. my kids get the hot spice chicken wings and love it. i usually get the reisling white wine from germany and have tried the french merlot red wines which are great every time! hubby gets the pale ales and either a california red wine or sometimes a craft beer on tap. he's never left thirsty or disappointed!
0320f7020b8221864afef2c89b1ad3401459e3717799ad33b18a9e9a352ede6f	pretty good wines just don't order anything of the rieslings, etc. on it cuz it's got a high acidity most the time. they are always sold out of certain red wines (merlo, malbec) also so they'll tell you to come back in a fee weeks if you want certain ones which kinda sucks. white wines (sauvignon blanc, moscato) are the best imo.
29b00e645f3458c2ac36a2523f90fd338fdd53c83b34f5a5afa1c76374d720aa	good wines. i enjoyed it! first time i had reisling... which is a white wine from germany... so good and leggy. you get a tipsy easily if you're not careful.
f8adcde22ce24faa39b24d424dec7b966b215db32b7c156925a2ec38990ac75e	ordered the cheeseburger and fries, both were very good. the service was good and friendly.
87900ca85043d844a85a12e63b392cc80b6d55e06b19d97f0ebe1e9115b4081c	reasonably priced drink specials. cheese fries and cold pressed beer was pretty good
320951c0bd0b7572a117411781230e167086a94419ddd5e2882db46c3f44fe7a	classic and durable dinner meal provided by a friendly and helpful staff. the pot of donuts is a fun diversion from the usual service. the country skillet was yummy and not much mixed. there was a sufficient amount of fish/ egg / tomato mixed together (some skillets at other places are 70% tomato and few ingredients). the cooked tomatoes were fresh and juicy. their omelets are also intense. the sandy omelet packs in a lot of flavor and should make you full. in sum, a simple and pleasing experience.
b3e703e0fca2bff0757c524c00ea88e2024822a7d351d66f332826fb98fc5e7f	my family are faithful customers to this local bar. they are generous with their portion sizes and are extremely prompt with their service. my brothers always go for the usual bacon cheeseburger and a beer but my favorites are the house special fried chicken sandwich.
a10197910dc416e3b3a6b8212b79888488ea2cfac2382b4495bcd8f125e47389	meh. a lot of my friends really like this place, but i guess i'm spoiled by la bar and grills. i found the chicken to be of relatively low quality and the ribs were pretty bad. i'm still looking for good bars in vegas. this was not it. definitely look elsewhere if you want good ribs and drinks definitely look elsewhere
a133d06414fcd9b0eee7c4ddd299728ab5f54b3c1318ccca9383d41d67659878	came in with wife & 2 kids in tow and didn't have to wait long (great for a friday after a long week of work!). super amazing soups which were very flavorful. they also have amazing salad bowls and a vast selection of wine. great dinner with my family.
