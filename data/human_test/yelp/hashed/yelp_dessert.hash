49d4b7be693533138d22766819a2cf9d0c0bc1059ce028cb18a453655eb56764	strawberry shortcake was good, icing and sprinkles were amazing! hard candy was not impressive at all. over all good experience. kind of expensive but it was big desserts.
917aee6c7cc9166cad4090632008214838d49f68a1ba804f104a43ecd5e8bf93	another excellent dessert restaurant. try the chocolate chip cookies. ice cream with caramel and fudge. great stuff. the hot buns are unique with cinnamon but taste excellent.
a2766fe60d0dbf7b831af2bc4523c8ef1f2b916d4239004b041034f20c19eb6d	to call this place dessert is tantamount to treason. ordering process was clunky. not easy to tell pricing -- ended up getting uncharged $4 on my ice cream for things like syrup and sprinkles that are standard fare at .dessert spots like dank cakes. dessert quality was average -- certainly didn't merit the premium pricing of a $12-14 dollar cake. staff was friendly and helpful.
f2605749f87f98ec44eec6bb19e7e0e83acacdc3cf19064954aeae7a19a2c7cf	don't order the dessert special here. it tastes not good. try their chinese dessert. it is about 7 with fried ice cream but tastes a lot better. i heard the custard tart is good too.
11d6b996bc3b361eb4ddb98ee2ceb09c0c2cd174946ae0e5fcbf12cc5ac0ff4f	cheesecake flan is pretty good. we ordered corn muffin churros that were not my favorite but i normally wouldn't order those so i'll definitely be back to try more!
e84977c05473b9ebf5a1ef51371af75c8d4a7dfb495cb96f470e8962c2487099	i love everything sweet, and i have eaten dessert in many places, including renowned restaurants in nyc when i once lived there, and this shop's cheesecake is as good as any i have ever had. it specializes in dessert, so they know exactly what they are doing with pastries and indulgent treats. another plus is that the decor is very nice as well. if i lived in toronto, this place would get a lot of my money. make sure to try the chocolate crepes topped with fresh strawberries. that dish was absolutely amazing. the butterscotch custard was great as well.
992b8bb159e39a4c87556f9261141de61e5db1f42d30a546a8863cbd5a5b01c6	i love this place. i crave the molten chocolate cake wayyyy too much. i recommend you cake lovers to dine here. worth it! the service is great as well!
55eb33c2db3298d211eba8138362099318bf61519ef840a5e5c92cb8f74219ee	this is one of the best mid-sized ice cream parlors i have been to in years. the servers were friendly and attentive, and they seem to run a tight ship there. the banana split and milkshakes are delicious! i plan on going back to try the ice cream sundae at some point. the interior is very nicely decorated, the seating area is more spacious than most areas at similar places, and they actually believe in leaving the air conditioning on when customers are eating! trust me, it was much appreciated. i plan on being back, and soon!
fe7fc9161892d466794e7644e1449902a23f601715d65c5bb722cc2c0a9bf4e3	the blackberry vanilla sponge cake is wonderful. i would recommend this place to anyone looking for great cakes

67c2caf0ec74f3ba15e59676ae7f3ad17d143db75d50ab77ca9eebaf4f8e25e5	ich liebe hofbräuhaus! seriously, i love this place. i love the rumtopf, the streusel, the atmosphere, and most importantly, servers in dirndls. even if you think you won't like german desserts, give it a chance. it's incredible. prost!
3a33d00bbb7ead51a0c1e4c4ea4cd0a22a6bcb751b1151a75c51d900c8908c2f	any place that has legit mexican fruit raspas with picante spices and lemon lime shrimp tacos on their menu gets the highest score possible from me on yelp

cf93b2f46ec5f1a526add431a15dd9edfd2e838f85317c865f5a468fbd32ef06	coconut cream pie. amy's baking company could serve nothing else and get 5 stars from me. luckily they dont. the quality, the talent of the chefs, the creativity of the menu, the excellence of the service make their angel food cake unmatched. the carrot cake is so well prepared and their pies always deliver something tasty. i long for cheesecake.
c1db84ec0763644a38357e4dc971f4ccb59d9ca70f285e56f31a49d84e0eb27a	i ordered 20 cookies, bubble tea, and sopapillas. i ask for extra honey and it's almost 30 cents for one small cup of honey. to top it off the cookies were stale, sopapillas were rock hard, and the bubble tea was more boba than tea. never going back to this location.
0b8f975b54c5dbce0d6178478be807b899867217cde064f7bb2538fa0279ba12	excellent food and service in a down home, welcoming spot. very good ice cream and flans at a fair price. will definitely return.

84f7eba29329c7d9bd3263bffb58bdd269fbfd9bb419a95a2e7d3494d908d1e0	how does this place not have 5 stars? it's open 24 / 7, has a drive thru. there's like no one ever eating inside when i've been. portions are big and prices are cheap. always clean. snack on some cheese danishes and chocolate chip cookies from the dessert bar, while you wait. heard a customer ask if they could fry the cherry danish from the dessert bar - robertos happily did. haven't had a bad experience yet.
f4e9deae501ac3b77cc09d76a78e893e64922450fd4c270031ad7ba7a72e4e9b	just started and getting the hang of it and eating all these muffins. instructors are nice and inviting. liking it so far.

0d8476ada3a214c9fb85a86ebf9c461045231b9922c0f0c3e9f424956797fc4b	after moving to the north phoenix area, the kona bakery has quickly become one of our favorite places to go for a quick snack. they have a great assortment of bakery items and drinks. we've only tried the cheesecake items so far and they are above average overall, if not just a tad pricey. but more or less in line for a bakery. service has been good so far and the back outside bistro area is quite relaxing to hangout without being overwhelmed by crowds.
fd7a74f1e2c0c7d2da535f5c1bac3ce45e286e70e89a3a27a9cdf7b0cff930c3	omg best ice cream ever. awesome service from waiters!!! food is made right and line is always quick!!great food, great desert too. the waiters are really nice and the dessert selection has variety than anywhere else in the menu

38aad5f9b70c4cf79b0ae424c866e035fafec26e6a1f5274ec158f584e36df8d	finally, i found a really good ice cream restaurant in clt area. their strawberry ice cream and root beer floats are a must. i also learnt that they have an american cone maker. i will try this next time.

77006f83ab376849cd6c964229975f56d6aae97c6d1860a40ec9b57afb4f274c	huge selection of traditional cakes, fruit pies and ice cream. the store is very clean and well organized so it's easy to find what you want. prices were average so nothing outrageous. they have a nice selection of local home baked desserts but i could not buy many things. some were best served warm, so you would have to heat it before eating.
3376c7efc10b06c9ca036f9830ae2879fc66f3ddb6dc09e7587c9e855cfe25bd	they are so nice at the bakery, they will give you an amazing sampler plate normally!  the cakes are fresh and amazing!  the icing is great and the cookies are amazing and funny, with great faces and toppings.  you could get lost in all the yumminess!

6bacd5162d74a6563c013ba7507a58673a7241f5f625ddfe51ea803992cb7635	delicious tiramisu cakes and strawberry milkshakes! i've had the chocolate chip cookie as well. the cookies were hot and fresh out of the oven. it is a little bit more expensive than the type of desserts you get in mcdonald, but every dessert selection there is decorated and hand made. it is well worth your money
2d1e0c857b11f1e2b2ae54aba6f8270f1e387b30ff3c3b7b5ae3469bb0825c96	worst dessert experience ever! after being seated, 15 minutes passed without anyone eating chocolate mousse. we flagged down a waiter who told us we should order apple pie. long story short, over 30 minutes before we even got peanut butter cookies. we like to try different desserts but never again with apple pie .

fc12f62353288cdafceb52e4e8f216b15b068283d224eac84baf8395f90c416c	super friendly. joe and memories was there greeting everyone, refilling coffee, and sharing how we uses local arizona suppliers. good and great diner food and decor. loved the biscuits and chorizo gravy. will definitely be back.

46be69e272437690471d14d42340855202036b6d676016ba62f82f2123be3e4e	the dessert and service was amazing, prices were extraordinary. had only italian sweets, gelato and cannoli with shredded chocolate. the chocolate shreds were probably the best i've had in a restaurant. loses a star for reeking of cigarette smoke. definitely worth it though.
a8aee57f347b8660388ba80c1b15681aac7232e27432f2ca3e62c71dcebaf7e6	they always have such a great selection of desserts, and give out helpful hints on how to cook some of them at home.  order your christmas cookies well before thanksgiving though as they can run out.
c1db54ed8001d8e6b511d5bf6757295d0a4b08e713bee46ca671f868c49472fa	awesome dessert. cheese cake filled with white chocolate and raspberries was over the top. breanna was a super server. strawberry chocolate cupcake was scrumptious.

5b85e8617f6fb14f34297004f969b5819795de139b6a49c40f7f5c85c25bdaaf	great neighborhood bakery and ice cream shop. i've lived in naples, the birthplace of desserts, and the cookies here are very good, as well as the chocolate fudge we ordered. if you get tired of german chocolate cake, and want some very good italian gelato, come here.
e21e2e8cf855438d3792c5e2661a640ed843cc861879a5755834401e8a78e94c	carrot cake with cream cheese icing was the best dessert i've ever had!
9b791e88376fe0bfd6fcde6826212dae191d597e7d894babb713fa6e8e6267df	good desserts presented nicely! fresh whipped cream with strawberries made right in front of you! if you're looking for some authentic dulce de leche this is a great spot to try out. tasted familiar to my mama's homemade dessert back in california. she was born in michoacan.
347d331c0157230e54d446fef49963cde4199adba9420d08d5cf51ae8ec84534	i have been to parallax three times now and it is the worst tiramisu i have had in cleveland. the frappuccinos were great, but skip the lava cake if you go.
062fcd7b2c682c8c1085c4379b9397ad202f7c7d49a2ff39107dd20fd761bfb0	their vanilla pudding is very delicious. i tried one weekend special which is the toffee cake and it was heavenly. it is so good. also, their prices are cheap. i didn't see any dessert, not even the biggest gelato dessert that costs more than $10. this is great for a student like me who can't afford nothing fancy.

a105c874f6304ce2a4f7fa6f822bd4797a1baf7bc3f292365aa182d523f19b75	this place is truly a 5 star sushi spot, best sushi ever! the best asian food in town for sure, and it beats peking's, can't stop eating, the whole food's sushi section is awesome. this is authentic asian cuisine. the owner serves and cooks the food herself. as a tip, come in for lunch before 11am for the dumplings and egg rolls!

113eaf69c4d95ba6855e54d2c2b792cdaaf13ec6d5d351bc25aca1576384dd63	came here friday for a late afternoon treat with friends. we ordered the gooey butter cake, chocolate mousse, and some banana splits. the gooey butter cake didn't taste as fresh as i thought it would be, but was still pretty decent. the chocolate mousse was delicious! experience was minus one star because our server paid no attention to us during the entire meal.
3567f3814da87888b4530f1741b5dd67ae79e611345160120f01075907b7c14c	amazing dessert food. had the hot apple pie and the french vanilla ice cream and was thoroughly satisfied with both sweet treats.

ecaea27d70d6ff7e6fa10880b2ab12c30202eda6461a1743d575069b133e137f	we stopped in for dessert. the hot fudge sauce had dark chocolate in it so when i ordered the mini chocolate lava cakes i was really looking forward to it. i got a plate of oatmeal raisin cookies. no sugar in the vanilla pudding or the jello. but i was really disappointed in the coconut cream pies which were tasteless. bur the lemon lime cake was great and everyone was very friendly
5efbab5dc868da43bd6bbf4759e57d1cc8f5c62709ee736a8810e6875bcd0c43	have only gotten take out,..stick with the ice cream and brownies. cookies are so so. the gummy worms is the best of the bunch.
ec3b3765ae6c46c3b1459f4e4bc26d5715b319d2bad74e9375e6f11495fee5e2	the gelatos are not genuine ice creams at all, though they are cold and sweet. the sherbet is not good. i won't go there for dessert again.

f16405295c67470d45f7c12cc5f8091716c46eb0b19247e034b27401deb9ad12	delicious cakes. what isn't on the cake display can be made to order. all very fresh. i will return.
cb8588153bc90c80fd8cc532a400bad47565b2080033f0970bc010d0c1fa81be	the reviews all sound great---but one big question----is it kosher. it could be---no mixing of soda and cake. all the cake could be kosher, but is it kosher?? i only eat kosher cake----is this kosher? who supervises?? any hecksher sign??? sounds wonderful!
27a99657224c467b8cf44703a12e04052850fe21f93c3b1a05f10c4685b3e5df	friendly service, good variety of ice cream flavors, and clean atmosphere. the brownie sundae, apple pie, lava cake, and rice pudding are flavorful. there are gluten free options.

a5a09cb50d92107ba437c97f66c386f3fab5ea3e990bdc41ad76720169d3c45e	ummm... tres leche cake.... i approve:) flan - was ok. churro was a nice dessert to compliment a meal. p.s. people... i know it's america but after so many years living in lv i have no trouble ordering food in spanish. just accept the fact that not everyone does speak english and get a couple of spanish food ordering lessons. don't diss the place just because of that.
93c0e36f9576b308a36b3cc6802c01f4b20b85112ec09796eee04368b47ba4d5	absolutely love this place. fantastic service whether eating in or taking it to go. fast, friendly and the order is always spot on. the sweet potato pie is my fave, the wife loves their chocolate custard, and this has quickly supplanted the artist formerly known as sweet frog down the street. skip the frog and hop on down to this wonderful dessert spot!
c4899eb2a996dd5e50aa92147bd8b42b527f29076e9d7e4076ea7ce4e0e61468	fresh ice cream and they were very nice. ayce for $26.95. try their fried oreos- sort of like oreo, bui added with mango and fried. each person can also get two pieces of gingerbread and cinnamon sticks. that in alone is worth it. my new fav dessert spot in lv. remember to get their stamp card, too!
a546b5ffe4e22f01f3f7428ab75c4e1a3974c8dbff0a0c51c5d5b69d7c71ab3c	this is my favorite dessert bistro. there is always good service and awesome desserts. they even have a hot cocoa bar on friday nights and a good crowd.

65d565a72db9d8c5feda98dc5cedf272e4bf9e8eb2211d03f493af139304e4f4	outstanding traditional desserts!  cheesecake was very good.  carrot cake was just ok.  the cookies were good as well.  their icing is really think but the whipped version was better.  even the coffee is good!  we are from the bay area and i guess we are spoiled with the best desserts.
f00394bb2cbc29565aa29340fdff3043fe5f9615ada8cf0c0d49545c0c8b8bb0	no cookies and ice cream... enough said! yum! such a great place for a snack.
e4490eacebada34b14232c412c3e2ac358feda0021cc4694fd8d82388aabe37c	my hot fudge sundae was just a lukewarm mess, and my cheese pastry was stale and not fresh. one odd experience as i have had better days at this shop.
b977b71f98fbce10373e307f947db47eea09fefb1e42f0992e3ed7c680b8036b	the brownie and the cake with the ice cream on top were sooo delicious. it was topped with whip cream and a cherry. it was really big, but i was able to handle it all, barely.
2f4a0122cab00dacf8cc1a60c645d52ccb624f7e8f58ca53cc8a7ab14928605a	they have great prices on freshly baked donuts and great coffee. quick service too! try their mini eclairs and bran muffins too!
a1c6240bd91df32eea87c8821e9c1198409ce7aaa550308664bc21e32f4ba36a	i love dessert food. i love the cakes and the various cookies and brownies that are served on top of it. the candy shop isn't a fancy place, it small but the desserts are pretty good.
55d57336fee6552242a4ee9dac1387c8294d87b261b2e4f4b3f31ebf9d7c915e	this place has really good cake and pie!! i went for dessert and had the red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting. it was excellent!!! the pies are very good also but the chocolate cream pies are a little bit sweet. overall a very good cake and good pies.
554c08a3cc167568a8fa0fe50778be07289007898dc1921c27a0e52f1e1ae171	we decide to have dessert for breakfast. this is a new joint. we all order peach cobbler. the cake is a little lighter than most of other southern cobbler places. if you like healthy sweets, this is it.

7fc7f56fdff9705a189ba2a19190daec882feefce8f1218b8ba390f401b2440a	this the most expensive place i've ever been to for regular ole' ice cream. it's 3-4x the price of ice creams you can get down the street. the funnel cakes tastes really good if you really wanted to blow your money on funnel cakes you can get cheaply else where (state fair?) this is from a very obese person who was eats about twelve funnel cakes and five scoops of ice cream a week......
8c63d092ed9bfed0778d237d2d434f1eaf89238ce220db71f8e219bf7305b0e4	one of my good friends told me about this dessert bistro and i've been going there ever since.  their cheesecake is delicious and they are not stingy with the strawberries.  i love their carrot cake also.  i always get a mug of their hot chocolate and then some cookies to take home.  my fiance doesn't care for the tight atmosphere and it is normally crowded when i go

c4febc562a25626425fa2ea9634214f43fe1033f6aee81336258e77cbdfb3dd6	(mexican food) this was the best food i have ever eaten. everybody needs to eat here, the quality of meat which was serenaded to sleep before seasoning and severing is the best part. this place is an 11/10 for me in comparison to other food joints like chipotle or filribertos. i will come here every friday.
7883390da998d28798e0fa282a7af99dfeaf3e61defb6a6e07da4d4039cef1f9	the last couple of times i've been here it has been great! although before the ice cream was a bit hard, it has been excellent recently. great spot for smoothies and desserts before night. $5 cakes

9bd43821cd41a38d3bdc104eb62a5d6f6a36864abbb5011cc29de96024d6db36	im a hard guy to please when it comes to wedding cakes. when they brought my slice of cake the first thing i could smell was the fondant (edible icing, for you non dessert speaking people) on that cake. i dig home made buttercream, so i knew this was gonna be a great cake. it was. oh and they serve hot chocolate, what more could i ask for;)
675ed862d5bfa11e4b8d4fd32d19cd775c6e5e5d76b043360b6f7257fbbdce71	we had brownies and ice cream with everything on it. so far, this is my favorite tiramisu with a shot of espresso . yes i wished they put more  espresso, but i think it's me loving the shots. got a full scoop and it was worth it. thanks
95b70c4721863e7cf1a39ff128c114d3a932eac5e334cacda898502852311580	great traditional dessert food.  had the ice cream sundae with caramel sauce.  it was sweet and huge.  tried the homemade waffle cone that came on top.  the caramel sauce was fantastic.  the cone they serve with the sundae was crisp and light.  the only thing they could improve on is the larger scoop of ice cream.  also liked the sweet cannoli sample.  i will be back for sure!
0acc9db1a5bd88df481ae9623e8ed56db500e3897ffc8088e3c89e1437d31981	amazing cake and good drinks. we went on a wednesday and it get busy after 10pm, unfortunately the ice cream maker was alone and the icecream took some time to reach the table but it was ok.
b4a6a81375471b050a95820cb645db253904ad18ff4bb8f1cf9688359a737f08	we're still exploring the menu - so far i'd recommend the vanilla cake, apple pie, flan and chocolate chip cookies. (there are jalapeños in the specialty donuts which gives them a nice kick)
9a258e0b0bc8d5f3274f3f75c93effb80987ded17aa844a21647295cb2ad1e50	delicious! pricey, but worth it for the service and dessert we received. recommend the tres leche cake and flan during cinco de mayo time! in the caesars palace hotel
81dc9ab6b8ee36bee26b4eefac7b575d86feb0a9287b6c3c30c5d8e436dbca2e	i thought the staff was super nice, friendly and attentive. i really enjoyed the complimentary hot or iced coffee that come to the table when you order a slice of cake. i was not impressed with the cake though. i ordered a chocolate cake and my friend a carrot cake. we were both not very happy with the food. i think they used too much sugar for the batter or icing and my friend just said her cake slice was ehhh.
45c4c4915c9567b7c7edafaa2999a301f0ce6578a4e43e343fe0417c62bb05e8	i'm never disappointed coming in and leaving.  i'm always welcomed by the owners with a hot cup of chocolate.  i highly recommend the swiss roll and soft ice cream!  for first timers, their bento boxes are very affordable with large portions of cheesecake, candies, and cookies.
d5d7cd8fb4f097a0f554877e7182d0efd949bcbedaf56f7da47294a5c4aa4466	great place to stop for dessert. place was packed after dinner time. everything was fresh and delicious. i like that there are a lot of cheap choices and the peanut butter pie is the best around.
a10197910dc416e3b3a6b8212b79888488ea2cfac2382b4495bcd8f125e47389	meh! a lot of my friends like this dessert bistro, but i guess i'm spoiled by bob's baker. i found the cheesecake to be of low quality and the carrot cake was very mediocre. i'm still looking for a good dessert bistro in vegas as it's one of my favorite foods. this was not it.
b9819b13338edd595d1a01be5669c232577a62a964ebcc0ad3266c319db1e5a2	fresh!! best chocolate cake in north scottsdale. try the coconut cake, lollipop grapes & chocolate fondue! great service. go for the food!

2fdb8c6c476221c8ac158b9d0a76019afc95bbfb959bab9464e354bccf804207	really bad, grainy cheap ice cream. don't go there, not even if you want to stuff your face with all-you-can-eat cookies and cream!
bc8092a650d99ac14c47a35d8f0e898e20f694c4a4b5936f47e7468debd8f07d	a great new addition to the fremont st area.we were on a dessert run as a group and stopped for a sweet treat .everything you need was there cake, pies, candy, fruit.i was impressed and will be back next year, keep rezitalizing the area it will draw more people.
a481fadfced09990d3076af1fb1a40e63b84298873b1d467cb2dbd15fd706866	we went there because the buffet requires 3 hours wait. it was a decent place to go. we ordered ginger milk curd and crystal cake. both of them were great! they used water buffalo milk to cook the ginger milk curd, which is very traditional. highly recommended!
5d7f756aa99a9c7b0c1ce9fe09f10247eed3b0b0bd3dd9837f0b871ccff894e0	i'm not sure why i gave this bakery another try.  nasty cheesecake that comes out soggy.  their so called carrot cake is not the typical cake you'd get at other dessert places.  but even that tasted horrible.  nothing came out hot or even warm.  i don't recommend this place.  if you want a good dessert, go to bob's bakery on main.
7465bc4a9e0d44494bc8e75b7ea3c587805c7a258df63eafec020f5c6e7c9c83	ok i have been back to this desserts restaurant several times since my initial review and i have to say this is my new fav dessert place!! i have tried the vanilla cake, the chocolate mouse with sprinkles and caramel drizzle, and most recently the apple pie.. that my friends is a knockout!! the whipped cream definitely wasn't from a tub or a can.. run my friends and don't miss out on this treasure seriously best desserts ever!!!!
a11ce7099bb26ee4eb67519fe5e7e9398aa30f2b8666cee720f776e75cb5fb2c	i heard this was one of the best cake restaurants in town, so we decided to try it out for my birthday. we enjoyed the velvet cake, fried oreos, and metropolitan flavors. everything was fresh, flavorful and tasty even though we did takeout and drove it back home to downtown.
1aeb583a78aeb4c58728938573844920f8aacdecbd5b004eca5b3404bb0542e6	awesome desserts!  decent service and there is a good atmosphere.  it's a hole in the wall honestly, but they have good desserts!

1c8000ea733cd664a0e44491cec9201373dd8e207cff44c3d35bd4a8aaaec6b0	you can't go wrong at edible arrangements!  it has something for everyone from fruit to smoothies to fruit shaped animals.  this location is super convenient on m way to work.  it's super fast service.  fruit is always omg fresh!  it is for real an orgasm in your mouth that you crave over again!
3e1b76f12163a37d19fc0380b8ac88a55ba13b0d5b9b43fe7156a6ee523190ed	food was bland, not the best apple pie i have had, decent sized plates, got charged for root beer and was told we charge for everything here, nothing extra is free. i would not recommend, much better places all over town.
e0013e879990bd4fa8230e32a6186b52a3c5882773ae2b2fa8d6c96a70b966a0	i'm a regular for their desserts, which are amazing!  as well as their hot chocolate.  but recently i stopped by for some carrot cake and it was pretty good.  a tad bit too sweet for my taste but the recipe was on point.
dd4ce69f5a4ab4a50eaedcc14b1b106e1f824eeb8e939137cfa3ca3938c4cc9c	valhalla is a great place to grab a cupcake and some candy. i used to live in copenhagen so i can attest to the quality of desserts. the cake selection also included some very good red velvet cake with cream cheese frosting, which can be hard to find in most cities in america. the whipped cream was great too. sprinkles, candy, mints, chocolate chips and peanut butter cups. i highly suggest this sweet place to anyone looking for a quality spot for dessert.
387a082ccda1f583dabdc6a242808dd39e903c085d3d8508a118d36892caae5c	love the chocolate cake and homemade ice cream! i've been there 4 times already! the deep fried cheesecake is the best!
607ad09d376d45ddd67f1d8f44551aedf112e96f5367d7d0d00357c4c180f8f3	its dollar ice cream day is truly a steal. the chocolate ice cream, vanilla ice cream, strawberry ice cream are all a dollar on ice cream day. my parents got the root beer floats, pina colada ice cream and strawberry ice cream. my parents like the root beer floats better than the pina colada ice cream. all its ice cream is very tasteful even the strawberry ice cream. i tried its cake before and it is huge and it was enough for two or three people. the waffle cones were good but pricey.
3a1ed9c2fc0ae22821d306594aab5b67d6ccb3b4860c8475272cdf2dfec636a6	so yummy!! makes me want to visit a bakery again! the spice cake with cream cheese frosting was amazing... and so was the red velvet cake! will be back here for dessert!!

18103f4dc596e202188b3440c81be40331d955c961da94eec90b066832d39643	best location hands down! makes the best milkshakes with mango!!! must remember to request the lime. no cherry ever, as it robs all the flavor from the ice cream and shake. it's difficult to not eat this 3-4 times per week... mango syrup is rather addicting and better than any mango smoothie i have tried anywhere!
affbd72797fcb1b8a679421292127a0e146f0f21959f3e82b86e762dd46053b7	absolutely delicious food. carolina's is clearly the top of the quick-service dessert food pyramid. i love that their cannolis are made onsite, and the creme brulee has amazing flavor. i enjoyed a macaron and cheesecake for my first visit to this location. i'm excited to try more items on their menu. i'm a huge cookie fan, so i liked being able to get as many cookies as i want at the dessert bar.
c9195e8620ff0c068cba03b9af4facf4af070c58ba0d778e0d1149e5d7444f71	beautiful inside and out. you should enjoy the patio even if it is hot outside, because there is a lake breeze. the best meal here is dessert. we had their homemade ice creams with an assortment of toppings, and also apple pie. definitely will be going back.

b4fb9f10722fa317214fcf1204359ecbd9f40b595c6f1a1a38f2ea99e755d8cf	great place to get dessert. close to my house and and my girl loves their ice cream for some dumb reason. got 2 big bowls of ice cream for about 10 $less the trip down here was well worth it. will ho back
81551e204af75df9cfa39896ad0910e7c8ce5ff3b23fb525499133a793ee3a9b	the cheesecake was absolutely delicious and the blueberry pie a la mode was outstanding. but the bad thing about the dishes were that they were really big.
b0aa6d66a11757a13dd50055e5da317f0e8e539aa9769f7a67282af0000737aa	we have tried every restaurant known for dessert in hampton/gibsonia area. sweet treats is the best. family owned and operated- they are fantastic and have a clean place.

f0f97c5bb990c2cd96de5bc36ac16c95706ee55beab64fd8ed19b0c067955036	the lobby was overflowing when we walked in but they have it down. we were seated within 10 minutes, had our desserts within another 10 minutes. out waitress, kim v., came to serve us right away and was the sweetest person throughout. we had strawberry cheesecake and hot coffee. she always asked us how were doing and refilled our coffees. the cheesecake was a 10/10. ihop is the best
ee30f058fcfcd46817b0e43e78c19e6fdd894ad011098070eeaea67d29284a70	awesome dessert restaurant. real spanish tarta de santiago (from spain), leche frita amazing good, crema catalana.... todo buenísimo. even the music is from spain: la oreja de van gogh, melendi... this is the only truly spanish dessert restaurant i have enjoy so far in the us. from someone from barcelona

201f4b28deed8d240884432f1842f6923138954a729884561fcfaaabe0217361	the mission @ minder binders is new and improved! they have an amazing dessert menu (the ice cream is specifically awesome!), and the staff is friendly and helpful. the patio is spectacular, and there's tons of things to see. a must see spot!

193443e4fc008f2b286fca80d94479fd61e94b25c3aca7cc858c1d7db12203eb	don't try to buy desert foods on saturday. much more important to stock the freezer than sell melted ice cream to customers. could not get food into my mouth without gagging and very rude when i asked to get a refund. left in a hurry and headed to sonic instead
1f9065f25a7114366fa464b00cd6225e98c24449b262f99623e12904209a1200	i ordered the chocolate strawberry cheescake and it was okay. the ice cream starter was so creamy and delicious. overall i'm happy with the meal and the price was perfect for me. the atmosphere was really professional. being a famous chef, he could easily have charged double the price, but he doesn't and i can really respect that.
dc255191b432d95ee5672380bd40dd2a671d3bce9c2a93eb774d224de81eb106	great specials, fresh desserts. definitely one of my new favorite sweet spots! love the chocolate chip cookies!

47012780b85c542a2052c242206b03c9cbf3792b92a1f8bf36cd4a22fd6a483e	went with white coworkers for dessert a few times. each time the server gave everyone silverware except me - i got spoons because i was asian. the dessert was grimey as hell. how do you mess up an ice cream cone?
7212cc0021e2236d2487c53ee24a3020cddc0c262e8cad3d33887ce1f21b010e	great dessert! love their dessert  menu - especially the famous pumpkin pie everything is made fresh and nice. it's busy so plan on a wait, but worth it!
c20fbe90cb43d0b37ee5bd7aaa0d3be99816e0f926579c69042b8d25e022158d	waited 20 minutes, servers walking by us constantly. not one tried to take our order. we walked the hell out of that dessert bar dump
781f3e5bd85ec7709421d30247fea4c0c35af62feaa4e336abd7e99727b2eee4	deep fried snicker fajita, little white ice cream, black frosting, carrot cake, gelato, mexican candy, spicy cinnamon ice cream, little gummy bears and guava cake
499bd2d246635a5e0a2cb65949cd6587cefbea00e61ae869d61c68623647691c	excellent bakery.  i ate at the bakery 2 nights in a row.  we had the carrot cake, fruit salad, cheesecake, hot chocolate, and some turnovers - all very good and perfectly executed.  service was efficient, polite and knowledgeable.  i will most definitely go back to this bakery when i'm in town.
36f09a0b37cfad73a23f22a15ab630a5b85e47dbdc26fd14c56187e69c1de31a	loved the root beer float, my husband said the strawberry cake was the best he's ever had.
1b2c1bb7d82fe592e0e14263bef121afa9a77e720c7a03e57df970551cf08bba	my opinion is that this is a nice place, where you enjoy dessert with authentic french pastries, in a family atmosphere. options are affordable.
705fcb4a71cba5b5b5d7ddaf4659a5da7e5d1e65dbc8a96ecfca309e32bc674e	spent new years eve. paid $50 for a cake with min $50 in cookies. but no ice cream was served. kitchen was closed. note that's a lot of hungry people with no dessert
9e2b8ff302e23a9b4f1b0a83d9c88b0ba02d98062e43cd92b209841fc190b657	i recommend this froyo place. the yogurts are delicious and creamy. i enjoyed eating the froyo. the various toppings were delicious.
72e63395a8d9b376d7ef1dd494455484544ef6db68a334acf58be9952bc95416	1. get there by 10 am on sundays! 2. the ice cream is awesome! 3. order the dessert tea with the meal, your tummy will thank you. 4. dessert dumplings, roasted donuts, custard, cinnamon buns, the chocolate rolls...all awesome. 5. if you feel adventurous, sweet feet, tiramisu, warm cakes with sugar syrup are all delicious!
d9510c78227228982b90e4fb97f00d89f2438d0ded9325505de63ca67b2824b8	fantastic little ice cream/ dessert joint in little italy. a hole-in-the-wall family establishment that is usually filled with large gelato samples and old time diner music blaring from a large screen television. portions are ridiculously large and cheap (the five scouped ice cream cones costs around $14 and is a steak that comes with giant waffle cones, sprinkles, gummy bears, and other topping, etc, etc). it's bring your own money as well so you can't lose. the chocolate ice cream specialty, a creamy filled ice cream shake- are also delicious.
9fd5588b9514aef087b1ce1ad6ae93a7b277562ebc9e4956729acdf995378bad	i was never a huge fan of ice cream, but my friend heard good things about ice caps at candyland so we gave it a try. the cupcakes paired with ice cream is defintely what makes it different.
c0c509941206ff14d51685213b65a1b58e0ec19c145edbc7e755f10e08482131	i've been there few times, sopapillas are authentic, chef is from mexico as well. i like to try the flan as it is healthier than fried flour. i've had the tres leche cake, churros, cheesecake, lemon carlota. tried almost everythting. overall, great desserts and friendly staff.
2f35891941b31472612a784891478054b3b8dc9f9db6c5bbbcd599cfa6c3f7c1	baby stacks is a good delicious place for desserts. we came here for some pie and they give you a really big slice. the staff was friendly and great customer service our waiter made sure our plates were never empty. we will be coming back, thank you!
b186a14a376bfb24d7b737b8c46a563ce7fa7228b41b114541db45756fad6805	my favorite dessert spot! i am one of those dessert snobs and though this is an ice cream place it is delicious. i love their dessert deals.
ff8f0577cf80137727b86f2c72aeb40290b31cbc3f62cb3ddd3afb446e6ba398	some of the best cheesecake that has ever graced my mouth. also, their carrot cake is to die for. every time i am there, i have to debate whether i should buy a large container of their icing to eat with a spoon until i die of happiness!
8d3b83a184cccc302a0e80aa9cb674fb4f1faa3ab81e55ba589d88876c5fc804	the caramel cake was so good! the caramel was amazing and the cake was so moist and delicious! i definitely will be back! how can you not love a place that has milkshakes?!
de547ed281feea1441e072084722f9da473032f74995f9e91654e832be50deaf	compared to other chick-fil-a's, this one is definitely has above average desserts. super nice folks and yummy soft serve ice cream. yipee!
0b10468ec6bbe3602ba7cf88e48cfb3798f8edf5f3357e0546aee165e0c0520f	the dessert isn't as good anymore! the quality is not the same as before. i think it was my last visit. was poisoned from the chocolate! i'd prefer to spend more and go to a real dessert buffet. check hi shanghai restaurant, fair price and best chinese dessert (dessert dumplings and more).
fc587795cdface6456862e305a03e6d734d6ba129849d1d234d83d208352771f	i've been here twice and have had dessert (pineapple upside-down cake and key lime pie-i think). chocolate was good the first time (milk chocolate) and butterscotch the second time.
3795147782e09b8d19685d3a2ade66f3b8d70d021349f1199abd380d5b91351d	great lunch spot. delicious sundaes and homemade ice cream. carmelo makes a tasty milkshake! the deals they have are a great value. i keep going back for more cones and sundaes.
59652f7fd8a530b8e280aa923937e3c6505c9e46fb7a20798fe31884f3d523d4	the red velvet cake is fantastic. every time. sometimes this some burros takes fooooorrreeevvvveerr to get you your dessert though. at least, far longer than sugar cookies should take. it's been more than once. just sayin.
e822293125294b51173c61e6e47e783961151bacd9681a71c3a8d9b5da5eac49	excellent waitress. delicious food. we had... salads. pierogis. stuffed cabbage. lamb chops.and the staff attitude is good.

c581f16af1f845c677ee47a2668207c54ddf8a757d36f1e1fb3bd1f10d287d37	i had the fried ice cream and a dessert burrito with chocolate. the dessert was excellent, came quickly, and was very cheap. i will definitely go back
6eb7a7bb5cc0e3da3dc5b55e94df8f2afa6ef50b43e3793468524bdef3adeaad	do not eat here unless you are having dessert with kids under 7 years old. slow service with whipped cream, overpriced cakes, limited espresso menu and pie is no better than denny's. milkshakes were made at the bar and tasted like kool-aid.
9e95faa7340fed9c7751cdae7a50321b78915c63335729163105b4558ecfa59c	i really enjoyed my first dessert from the bakery. everything was great. definitely will go there again.
0df20405db1fe88ef7d6a877aca0bad3285c209fc220272e790e963aaca0eeb0	if their creme brulee, chocolate gelato and brownies please my dad who's a dessert master chef, it deserves a 5 star. maybe even 6 stars.
e91e637e1407aabb82fa28d7661e36043d38c3fa7dcb419a0866930df83a8e7b	i was born and raised in chinatown. if you lived there before you gotta know this bakery. lately they have switched owners but the desserts still remain the same. i gotta say this is probably the best bakery in downtown. the price is relatively fair compared to 88. their portions of cakes and pies seems to be big and the icing is very tasty. definitely legit and owned by vietnamese people. i am always there when ever i'm in chinatown.
ae319e60b1c211a559eca812870b341bdcb33a7339cfb736f956cca53c16963f	i ordered the hot chocolate.  and for the money i spent, i expected a larger mug.  my wife had the carrot cake, it was much better than the other bakery in town.  i had the cheesecake and loved it.  we plan on going back.
e856d6a010ffdbafa5772a32dfd058c931f46320fe7d32418e7cf2e1ecff0248	the dessert at this place are amazing.i had ice cream the portion was right and it was very yummy. my boyfriend chocolate chip cake. it was great
87afee4e6cff21f6e59b992199ee70d3d1f85352c4b4787a1fe71285e3c4bb8f	great bakery in many ways. the pastry is sweet--strudel and a honey bun are enough for two to share. they've got a couple of different milkshakes, one chocolate and one vanilla, both pleasantly flavorful. wonderful place to get away from tourists, most of the folks there are children.
eb10cdced30b6139e045316d09080415423fd3443bc81340c368e7d408e1cd42	decent but not any better than el apollo loco and the owner of restaurant was arrogant and not proper response for the orders . but the restaurant place is health hazards. take a look around on the doors and bathrooms. so gross!
1ef6a635c5a4ba6ac3a9c215a659b4d5689ce09382da2fccb812814aad8c76ff	i love this place. very friendly and the pastries are awesome. it's a must place to go for desserts when you are visiting stuttgart.
08a24036a4ac909569f60110b0998a78448ae945437b67ab58e370e9dff924a7	decadent, organic and delicious. love the bananas foster and chocolate cheesecake.
a7b88184192b964c961344100a3bcd496f8bbdbc38feae7f72c1605064ddd144	i have not had any bad experiences eating at this dessert bistro.  their food is wonderful and i'm picky.  my favorite is the new york cheesecake with strawberries and the carrot cake with creme cheese icing.  their cookies are very sweet with lots of icing and their homemade candies are yummy as well.  i love eating here.
44b3d9e9ae5419c3fbd8277925160efac3fb8a0444e23bffd8a36cf70f9be387	awesome desserts!  i found this place while visiting from the far west valley and will definitely be back.  it was worth the drive for their homemade cheesecake and strawberries - it was great thanks!
e232e39b6ace4dbd6877081033366a9d4b2374a04a21db47f22fa8b52f8bcb4f	very nice place to eat coconut cream pie, cookies are amazing, i highly recommend cupcakes from this place for dessert
9b8083e3c4edacb594e8edd671f57d315cde03614bbd804005534f499cdace65	the barista, benancio, was super friendly!!  the cakes and pies at this dessert bistro were yummy!

a4f11f3fd86826fdc6cd7cc706c42b0a3bb55ce600918bdcd4f0364c25dab43c	it's a dessert chain so i think legally i cant give it 5 stars. i placed my semi-custom order and the ice cream came out perfect. the staff including dante are all super friendly and really make an effort. this dessert bar is better than your average ice cream joint
34815979f917dffa8ac1bca7d9cda781caa22b85d011afa9cb39b376f86c607d	picked up ben and brandon at tennis camp so had to stop here. plus you can get scoops at noon! giant cinnasticks that are great also. pecan pie takes time if you order a whole pie - 45 minutes for a thick crust, but worth the wait.
4663a171dfd6efef137452fdd13992200d1f656ef22d2168fa8e7176aa1e9ca7	scrumptious cheesecake, we will definitely return here! emily kept our coffees topped up and was a great server! we had the double chocolate cheesecake and it was loaded with chocolate shreds. very rich and the cheescake is gorgeous. highly recommend!
2b1dfac1ca4d7b55ed5f48e49fb2b2703e23262ce620088f3594d96edb1d90f3	surprisingly, good dessert is not that difficult to find in the valley. 85c are another very good find. the puff pastry egg tart and sweet breads are fantastic. the iced matcha tea and real fruit bobas are incredible. and my main, the steamed bun with egg custard filling was perfect. hot and steamy soft, fresh from the oven. wow. very good. our server was very cool, but that probably has more to do with my gorgeous wife. now if they could just provide a free iced coffee with every purchase.
59252fb740ac5a2a687b3323539f0a021ddc273dc2ad5e65e6899549529f8ff4	amazing ice cream. felt like i was in nyc not phx. very fun atmosphere! best ice cream i have had in phx. must get the "oh my god" scoops!
7118ddbd7f083a1b7470ad0ea6761702eeac539470bb2dbbad7d2f58b43609b6	probably the best ice cream bar on this stretch of pearl rd. friendly staff, reasonably priced milk shakes, and a large patio that is smoker friendly. they also have a sand volleyball court for people enjoying dessert who want to play in summer leagues. great atmosphere
7d9263e64f002819b68a892a54cee57d4c72be62c9072c96cfaa6ed98cc3ef1f	real cake, made right, best cake and ice cream place on the southside! cupcakes, coffee, sugar, and brownies are all good.

af2529fe493d0392c6b7bb497076f9093d0eacc16d1c19aae827ec6ab3e2b01e	my husband loved the vanilla cake and chocolate chip cookies and i got the apple pie with caramel and ice cream. the desserts were delicious but the licorice was a bit tough. overall we would go back!!
df251cef749e1608415899b1b985f0674b8ff5497382f75f85bb1e12074304c0	the presentation for the dessert is always really cool and neat! the carrot cake is really good and the carrots make it a lot healthier also.
4bb72c705769af2e75e56460fe3ee1cdab12b1b4154e65bcd2edf4291d1a8710	my go to dessert spot in chinatown after van roy's had closed down several years ago. custard tart and ginger milk is always great. always a special place in my heart for new dynasty!

f07e02c3e2619b482e1cf80185cc455409c7bd312f3be445dd60c5daea8e25cf	we decided to try this place for dessert one more time. no one to greet us except for a rich, dark chocolate smell. we had the cookies and cream ice cream. the chocolate sauce was ok, but nothing special. our server did not come by and offer to serve cookies. overall chocolate fudge was okay. we were not impressed, so we won't return here for dessert.
22d4991a937d9cf9db17d0eb91266a988a54e0be76f99583c628b458aaf4efc4	the great thing there? the cake was awesome. the worst? customer service. immediate blacklist. wow...

445907a6eaf1f0fcc6042415d822d2fa84d67c0d3cfcbeff5716333f0cdab1fc	we waited over an hour for our creme brulee when the restaurant was half full. other tables were served their dessert that came in 20 minutes after us. the hot apple pie was warm at best and tasted tart. terrible experience with sweet treats for the price. we will never be back for dessert.
41e7079fef8a9c54f0fc0133ef57fec4f8e0f26199333be3ac260d4758ea5589	great cupcakes! all you can eat! have a milkshake with it. it's great!

8e43c4ca1248b9539a795379ef2027b890ce69a9465aac5ee64a4c7e0a31c089	please return the task as our server may be running into issues

0a4d144868e5bb1ffee1fe43416a407f2eedd51621474f31f367bc06a6581472	mmm hmm it rivals red hot lovers of ann arbor, michigan. i love a good chicago churro no matter where it came from and matt knows how to make a good churro.
80acbe0caa85eb6e5fbea305db5f6df718ba4097600c14bacd8e26307b74d883	our daughters loved this froyo place so much they requested to get a treat here twice on our trip to madison! loved it! can't wait to go back one day!
761d36b9c700552286fbb04a85e24aa9d3335e7f4facbfb6de9fda831674a003	delicious desserts breakfast. we split the ultimate- tons of cakes and the mochi were the best i have ever had. waitress was the nicest and best we have had in vegas. definitely will come back.
4093f1dacb61abf7cbfab901a830a1e9c29e263e37541d455ff1d6511fdafb81	great staff! the candy is really good for dessert. good for family, friends, or a great dessert. they even change the channel for specific games
64a43491759b1dffe7e5263c8f13a29a710efec221e07bf1874e14d8c400e331	one of the best go to places when you're in cave creek. chocolate is great, truffles rock! got to spice up the chili chocolate bark though, it's pretty mild for the tourists! the turtles and ducks in the pond are the best entertainment lol
2bc47b2296e7edc02017f40334983f40819e05615395093e9816661a0985cc89	before this dessert, my favorite all time dessert had been at charlies in chicago.  that dessert is now tied with the one i had at bob's.  very interesting menu, creative flavor and texture combinations, amazing execution, beautiful presentation, and spectacular service.  the cheesecake is transformative.  i also loved the cream cheese icing, the hot chocolate, the cookies, and the candies - this is a very special dessert experience.
5035593555d4a8ad9d027c7936d7ab2da112f6b41f18df8f6ec105a0f1241516	these guys are great. a little corner shop reminiscent of the bodegas of my native east coast (that have delis inside). these guys have an ice cream stand inside that has some of the best desserts out here. the ingredients they use are top notch. very tasty, very clean. diamond in the rough.
d43409955acc0b9120c64ff2fecf6a1268bd0bb31112473939dbfaf108f9fcbf	my favorite sweets store. stocked and portioned correctly for a couple or small family. really like the fact they have a tasting counter so i can taste a new dessert dan's product every time. pick up their weekly grocery ad, it's so much better than generic pictures of ice cream and other dessert products
b6ca531f8c8e7bc367ecd99b682dfd07c77998e5adfaae6038dab243953d5ec9	the desserts here are terrible.  the crust on the cheesecake is so hard it's like eating cement.  it's supposed to be a light thin crust but it's just really a cheap crust.  the place is always empty and for good reason.  terrible desserts, bad service, and high prices.
ee83d1a3a30a035fde2c812a39721f4b5c220dd785828749efd0e29f971c6a54	the vanilla cake was really good! the chocolate chip cookies were absolutely bland the rugala was tough. the peach cobbler... i'm not sure if it were burnt or if they meant to overcook it. if i had time i would turn around and drive back and get a refund!!!
5efc077f0c8dcd5e4e116dd248e43fa0fae7ef469daaf81d78ca8a8336d0c6bf	you'll get your ice cream cake faster than you can say cheesecake and bursting with sugary goodness. my favorite is the rainbow sherbet... anything...cheesecake, cookies, etc. if it has the rainbow sherbet, i'm down. their milkshake is hit or miss. sometimes it's too sweet
f4e566787112463aac363c7aea789b8960c12ce2dfd7e24308d40a1cfae58a5b	ok... so it's in a strip mall and it resembles a cookie factory... the sweet treats however do not reflect the surroundings! it's delicious! seriously! the biggest chocolate chip fudge cookie in the u.s. and one of the most delicious. the chocolate chips are fresh and authentically prepared. this isn't your sugar free version, this is the authentic chocolate lovers' version. go here... eat mas!
c753cfcd270636efe7833950b86ca91938533b111a2fa630eb375f1e21e54931	really delicious snowcones... but you can't make many changes to the actual menu item. we ended up having to order multiple different flavors to get everything we wanted. try the watermelon kiwi lemonade or the mango strawberry blast... amazing!
6e20dd1e4947db051807a231f5198924fc0de96653633f13f471f3c99c0794c7	the pistachio gelato was excellent. the cheery jello was very good. the bowl of ice cream i had was slightly over melted when i received it.
f576374c74252475f4a1e08da5b52bdecac7c4b025c3942fe489e5e46b959a83	the sinful deep fried oreo was bomb!!!!! vinny is an awesome baker, whatever he is.
22e3a31d9922bc3a6f24987549599bd8cae27a1fea62a39e2d91a27e9c8bf959	delicious bakery. i prefer the butter rum cake at aria, plus they have better chocolate and strawberry desserts.
ffd04d5ebab0117074660cab22062c6f76e7c01726c6c2be1824e6ee22198644	ideal place for breakfast. had the vegetarian-crockpot-stuffed-peppers and it was decent. the top peppers and salsa looked amazing. our waitress nancy was awesome.
d2ab11c0ad8b892d29f7b1b6202b3ad510deb9116199b8194545d39bc4c9cb89	this is one of my favorite restaurants. great price and service, top quality food (especially dessert)! my favorite desserts here are dessert squid, fried ice cream, tiger pastries, and roasted donuts.
67c97a5bc0707d4edaff34cfbd2174aa2dd2d4b67039c681ed4c91258072d980	i got the chocolate chip cookies, strawberry ice cream, pistachio gelato, and chocolate cheesecake. these are my favorite on the menu and they're also the best tasting. i brought this home to the family for the first time and they really liked it! i don't normally eat a lot of junk food but i go to this place because its quick, cheap, and convenient. try it out! you won't be disappointed
9a41738773158fa6108ed6be28a08e991331e0cb813ce7cc9f4fb8d768e8b8e9	very good french desserts. we had a party of 8 and basically everyone said they would make another visit. we ordered crepe's, a souffle, a chocolate mousse too. and i couldn't forget the delicious and famous opera cake of course. the service was extremely polite and efficient. they even went out of their way to seat us in a special section. they were dressed in a french way and there was even french music playing. would recommend 100%
d9107e08f28f909e3eebddac09e9c712a335c958ac577c9522cbc46a781b54f0	average desserts... yeah i said desserts... there wasnt much chocolate. the cherry pie a la mode wasn't bad. i would not go back for sweets.
9c42936c9f6bd080bdcd77696c3d07370c58fba7d999aa4faff0fc7ec6e12728	nothing bears authentic key lime pies! i spent 8 yrs in the keys so i can truly say this sweet pie is the real thing! my husband is a sweet tooth and he had the triple fudge brownie, sugary! i had 2 chocolate chip cookies and one pecan pie with the pie! delicious and affordable dessert!
ed86690409238bf8b65247039af0eed23653d721473cce1194844ff2ff6a4132	came here for desserts and a business meeting with my crew, and regretted this choice. seemed like an over priced ice cream bar with tacky decor. yikes! wish we went elsewhere.
5b30f8878b192fd706488fd7544db94f7a89720d69f421870b7271361524a22a	if you're looking for a sweet snack after a movie or show, try pedro's. it's small, it's old, and its good. they sell handmade donuts, cupcakes, eclairs ... need i say more? price is a little high if you ask me but for occasional visits it's ok.
99ce26fbb56744d94a4b4301dfba80eec84e7965b0ba24478b02b62a59e2d71d	out of this, out of that.. inappropriate dialogue between staff and not very attentive. i don't know what else to say.. i had a not so pleasant experience. not to mention my mediocre coconut cake and vanilla ice cream totaled out to be $21. i shoulda went to red lobster... hahahahaha
93ed17f1e9ff7b963d924c59e67f8d6e4a0038956d6a644aa480d80b0242657f	by far my favorite froyo place. bethany at the register is the best! great service and fantastic yogurt. highly recommended!!!
e1245b422a7f7b3c0a75f9a0cd76a7fe59df6df707015adf937a0d9e25a6d18d	i had the ice cream crème brule it was amazing! i would definitely recommend this place i love frozen treats. better than lucilles.
b4a3fada261421e295d7b577dcfaa3e4d1c6e7224050ea8f655c29669d6ea10f	they have amazing, large portions. we really liked the carrot cake, cream cheese icing, and hot chocolate.
16cfb3663a867c66e7c7e97f8de59fa8043eae70f849d757f1f4e16108c0e3fe	my fave dessert place! my two favorite ice cream together are a scoop of plain old chocolate mixed with a scoop of mint! the way to go! decent prices and for their ice cream scoops compared to others! will be back in an hour!! hahahaha
927add1206e64cc07f14597185e72882e06b580eff6fcb7f55a0bfdd20eaddf8	the tiramisu is delish, i order it every time i go in along with a strawberry cheesecake. the snacks are always made fresh to order & service is great. the pricing is excellent. i go to the henderson location while at work & the location on craig rd when i'm close to home. this dessert parlor is a must have for a quick quality snack......
8356f3c8d12f3f13b193f30302ffe9c0fd1229cd654c2f30c1f82683d645bdb0	apparently this place is also a nightclub, but i was not impressed with it as a restaurant. the space is nice and the service is great, but the desserts are just average. i have had better tiramisu at chain italian restaurants
a532fa61edb80b6da887e9b3039c83d8dbd0382ce5d464f3775b5f48c9bcaed0	i absolutely love and adore this place! , the delicate and creamy panna cotta, fancy semifreddo and fantastic tiramisu are my favorite.
03240749134a4acfeabbf02b668a94f43a472ce454b88007171dadab5a25cf9f	delicious desserts!!! we enjoyed the cakes and flans (their brownies and ice cream are on point) and the mamas fried chocolate french toast. service was good, people there are very attentive and kind, prices are super affordable, parking is not an issue... expect to wait at least 20min, they are busy but it's totally worth it
29aaba7005358595d3a72c1f054cd71d5ccf13d1b0af512b7caa4c1f0b5d26c1	wow, i had never eaten this amazing steak, macaroni were amazing with the best in the world. classy and stylish. a great run for festivals and groups that organize different festivals. it is costly because the quality is paid but worth it. get porterhouse to share with the table - the presentation is great. batali never disappoints and is the best in the world!
3763a92062675b7310d0b3513a21cadfeaf953b1b9e3d044755d571880c297bc	the girl working the drive-through needs to get her shit together. cause she doesn't know what she's doing at all. she dropped my ice cream on the floor... twice! bad service
57cbce1ad9b3d00b75bd6c496ffa32772f94a249d589030ede858e9a6b56f737	it's olive garden's, of course it is good, just like the location in hill country ranch pizzeria and the one by carino's. they have some of the best mushroom tacos with mexican brown rice among other great pastas and meat dishes. never gone wrong on anything i have ordered, chicken parmesan, lasagna, etc. if you have room try the biscochito, so good.
2b7978a6097a07fccca3e5806e0b70aaee4278ff0e7206947a5f314c88026bce	my go-to place for quality desserts. my favorite is the xl vanilla and cinnamon ice cream with caramel sauce and tapioca pudding with mango, but the apple pie and cheesecake are great too. it's a few bucks more than your average dessert shop or cafe but the high quality ingredients and perfect execution make it worth it. delicious, good and reliable.
290725d2fa2f19517baa9e304e3702db8b3de89d2c754dc8513c4ac143c2ec26	two amazing discoveries: best cheescake ever and the heavenly banana-lime cake- takes you to the seventh heaven, i swear! highly recommend their dessert foods.
190771b8b4e475ded5f300e711242ff70cfe323734d5dbb9a1fb127d6bbd5a9d	this place is always great all around.  i love the hot chocolate, love the barista (dave), love the desserts, love the patio, love the vibe.  but the best part is the cheesecake!
609680e158cb94fd2bdc0af8fb0ee25f55af38334fc77e9bb7818576e23e15de	we would give chocolate chip cookies if possible. nothing like the bakery in irvine, snickerdoodle was sugary. my taiwanese lady said, and i agree, sweet! don't forget pie
d1f4d29fad52ad14e59c01a328563ac587d06dc7776a5e3a5a1f63f373657d10	awesome service, amazing flavors! i got the silky smooth velvet cake and the supple smoothie and it was absolutely delish!!! the japanese lady server i think is the owner or manager she was super friendly she even packed me the vanilla pudding oil togo for my togo flan i had to order one togo it was that yummy! yes my tummy is much satisfied
91e9bb06faf45a814418e6d785f38c36d2c515de7589b8f9689502796924d73e	chipotle is amazing. need i say more? i highly recommend dessert here.  i am not a fan of sweets but i love the churros because they have just the right amount of cinnamon sugar. chipotles are always busy but the line generally moves fast. you will be so glad you stuck around for dessert.
19bca0fac186b01144b50718ed81c8f78bfc9d45e2218cea1b8a5f543d1a224d	china desserts is pretty decent on the side of american chinese dessert food. we had almond jelly, a coconut bar and egg custard. hubby and i went around 8: 30p and ordered, good service, delicious desserts. if we happen to be in the area, will def go eat again!
3dacc3e467a54bbe6f24f1b2f39f6a3390247b8de52e3c4c450c59fa58256207	11 $for a soggy churro, and pretty sure the flan was bad. i'd rather go to dairy queen
0a31b08dbf3346e00edb3297e198a5fd7f8dae940a9fe469c02c4703174e16f6	just finished one of the best fried oreos i've ever had! i ordered the hell's kitchen fried oreo and the cake. the experience was what you would expect from a gordon ramsay restaurant. the presentation was spot on. the fry on the ice cream was perfect. it was juicy without being messy. everything was perfectly seasoned. the waitstaff were friendly and knowledgeable and the food arrived in a reasonable amount of time. i couldn't have asked for a better experience.
9983f5ab4f77664e4d18fd2588c769a8b2f97707128927aa5456d99bb9bb5669	good service. solid desert food. i'm a regular. the chocolate cake and shake is one of my favorites. the cheese cake with homemade frosting is one of the most popular items
49bc155d53cffe80dc22974ffd9ea7a5d88a5fe66e5a0c02d0b704f83637c129	easily one of my favorite local spots here for dessert. they serve the most amazing boston cream pies.
4f11a861cc224c9ec955fbdfde08ecfc1909dea48eecf3121abd7aebeedc163c	where do i start? hot fudge chocolate sauce.... freaking yummy!!! marble brownies... yummy... and the chocolate cake so moist and juicy, and sweet and tasty. i cannot wait until the bakery on the west side of town is finished so we can eat dessert more often. wish they had a few more chocolate chip cookies on the menu but in all.. most of my family love cupcakes and pies. thanks for dessert!
9d32b9b4c14e0012f4149bbb4a8521421bd0d47c7a75776343c732c8b7e63b1e	nothing overwhelming here.  seems like pretty generic desserts.  the desserts were passable but i've had better.  was more italian than american desserts though.
eeac8e992089453c30aebc3574887cc28c67390f3768865dd9304bc7068319f8	delicious tacos, quick service, and friendly staff. 2 tacos was a filling and satisfying lunch.the staffs have good attitude and quantity of the food is worth able for money.
ebe910149301634fdda7ae3ebb14e572dd5c958872204a667b4187877127c3d5	started off with a cherry in the side of whipped cream. then a cookies and cream ice cream that was for a dessert had a thin shmear of chocolate sauce. so after asking for more sprinkles, went to add them into the ice cream, only to find large chunks of chocolate brownie as though the brownies were cooked with chocolate chips completely disregarding that walnuts could not be included
2f6d96242c6e0b2559cd62df5a148a35c051c7a1d77de2397c97d225a7bbad88	no fuss, the ice cream is great. they have dozens of different flavors from plain old vanilla to rainbow sherbet. i will certainly return, and totally recommend it to anyone looking for some good ice cream and other delicious desserts.

5c0155704583095c25cb4fa7f642acad3dfa4538b08cd1621e44f5b6be23bd8e	don't let the outside fool you, this place is legit.  nice selection of coffees (even hot chocolate, are you kidding me!), pretty good cheesecakes, great carrot cake, awesome decor.  i practically felt like i was in an italian bakery.  i'll definitely be back.

cb90e470806ca736f0216f3b91237e46a9925fc9c61c1dc8b4974a206807e175	love the fried oreos! they make the churros fresh to order, have awesome flan, and have fresh pies to eat with the churros or take to go. i haven't tried the other stuff yet, but i have had the ice cream quite a few times and have never been disappointed!

3df415dc6ec38b4da6fff2585ad8110768eb9a6fc343228f2269cfebc2c44016	since my first visit, i have been back at least 8 times. drive thru is usually a little slow. i usually order a brownie, like said in my first review but i decided to go with a frozen yogurt with mango sauce. i didn't care much for their oatmeal cookies, too bland for me and too much oats. but overall delicious desserts, worth giving a try!

d8a4a2446af6f0332dfd42175019551d65b1b07459afe03d88e1ab13f016eb29	the manna banana butterscotch crepes that i had are the sole reason why i give this dessert shop 5 stars. otherwise..... it's overwhelming in there man. the line goes out the door for people who want a taste of these sweets.
6564e16cb1cf8f71d14cce6386ab4e29989cae7b314e89f83738d5b7652f240f	good place to enjoy a banana split. they have a nice selection of desserts. delicious sweet treats, so stop there.
e1b0f05c2755fd0f463b9f85e1ed09c9cbcba78b6fe06c71451616b3f571a430	i've been back multiple times, also to their new location in mesa and detroit desserts is good. i stick with my gut and order the coney specials everytime but if your craving a detroit ice cream, or haven't had one, you won't be. thank god for people that don't do disrespectful shit like put sprinkles on sherbet ice cream. i still think the flans aren't meant to be blueberry flavored but just get yourself here, eat, and be happy.
a9e5dbcc2e3455e5639ba137c34ac75cf0f5c3627588f61f01a8a039d72f6c80	i'm writing this review as i'm eating my churros drizzled in chocolate sauce. soo good. i also got the flan with extra caramel. also sooo good. definitely recommend for great dessert at a low cost in vegas!
207cd8caac4141c41a0d0977ef3ba2df7747083281ac41ff08789e2df91a150c	delicious desserts my favorite cavacas ever (believe me i've tried many)
411b9fc7652c43c15f1f4ace9a4d74ae693c4be4d5dac71b1b4fcacdd64a6b48	the ice cream was delicious. melted gummy bears are yummy. portions are large, prepare to eat! karla, our waitress, was attentive and very pleasant. definite go to breakfast place off the strip. bonus is the free iced banana nut muffin with the yelp check in. so, so good!!
ca7585840dfe6528643fd5b469205e8ecd23eb3823db60e41713f8db694bf187	first time eating at this dessert shop tonight! it was excellent! i had the strawberry pie, my husband had the mixed fruit tart. we both think they have the best pastries in vegas!! awesome!!
e1931eda5df4072b7ae3f944baa35e661d7fe457e526a76c85b251056508772b	my fave chinese spot in vegas (coming from oc) everything is delicious & worth the wait. (don't mind the service) chao hong guo is always worth a long line
1587b57942a0d4e8c9662ba273b231fe74ce2c30517ce4026318f73e513dc052	i live in california now, but i definitely miss the frozen yogurt flavors there! i haven't found any other place anywhere near here that even comes close to their desserts!
ff5fc7b08cedc9b1a635f377648db93a3fe80c96190d6d35cf45302b8f5a39ff	had the cal cheesecake. ask for extra caramel syrup, it is fresh and wonderful flavor. my wife had the short stack, light, fluffy with thick sliced crepes. great spot if you have transportation from the strip
0c49cd5aa31bd1f64a0a5ddccad70cc9a09b4d5f2cd052059a307b9e9edf59e1	nice that they put a coldstone here. what more needs to be said? coldstone is love, coldstone is life. thank you for delivering high quality ice cream at a reasonable price.
1b4f6fc0abc75407eaab6fa80635982595adf890ae4ec98037a1ec87c7270799	little hot on the inside, but i guess that makes sense since they are baking in the ovens. the service is good and it is family run. all the desserts are good, and especially the chocolate tart that i had.
5248ab6d3197f5c978a26c0c8eadb8a042723ac4df1d57ed16b35bc7e381a9ec	one of the best nights i've ever had in vegas. the dueling pianos were awesome! pay the 15.00 for vip seating it's worth it! the smoothies were around 8.00 dollars and they didn't skimp on the oreo pies.
ed8337757b44314a3766cbe11c518b198d9b77d079047ed2f0c7e1f579caa810	i love this drive thru. i've been coming here for over 10 years, it's a great family owned brownie and cake store. make sure to ask for the cookies and cream double fudge brownie special.
482520bdb4fa320bd9405ca29e5648ae94b9dd536d308aa8f72dfc4caa47ee86	amazing cookies and the ice cream was wow i almost cried it was so good.
9500804c18c9739ed57e3e0054f951a8667f59a2607fa279978a2831bfa8870d	best candy shop ever! the ice cream are amazing- just like peaches! i love the brownies and chocoloate cupcakes as well as the sugar cookies. i used to be a baker dozen on central die hard but this place has a better menu.
a0c3718886cde4a6ea9cb76f06a61acf37fdd6d7d6093abf5348641c159b7793	food was bland compared to other dessert options. not to mention the cake quite literally sucked all the moisture out of my mouth. beyond dry. won't be going back.
d833b1dc5e07f2cb1a48fb7c94cf74373ea2e9aeb552bdf43feb6dc10b6f987a	i've been here a handful of times over a decade or so. the quality of the tiramisu is great, but it is definitely twice as expensive than tiramisu in chinatown (spadina and dundas area).
3dbd1c5d3a98bd5d1f0575bbb98a778701661dbaa195fd364214285a864d07e4	my favorite dessert place!  i would never replace it.  their customer service is about the same as any other bakery but they're fast and i'm all about the quality of the dessert!  it's an a+ to me!
733aa944a36203ed7caff50bdf96eea486fad30b74c940257e42eb496b73f590	food is great as well as their customer service! we got brownies and ice cream, triple  a tiramisu my friend said her  tiramisu were yummy and my triple  tiramisu was so good i ended up eating the whole thing! the shots of espresso were not the best
45a60607d9188bee61506483e5eb34539ad0c969c1cad6bc9f0083bb7c3f0ae5	it's a bakery, and it's much like every other sweet shop out there. except that the triple fudge chocolate cake with chocolate sauce here is always above standard, which i sincerely appreciate.
81f7a888891fb7262085ec1230143cb6a0adf6ebf79b3296b1ded8a195343a06	food was excellent. i had wonton soup and hubby had hot and sour. both were hot and delicious. the dumplings and rice noodles were wonderful. this is a small, cash only restaurant. definitely worth a stop in montreal.its credit card free restaurant. soup variate are good.
cba5b264ad5c18cdb149f85c64de60ae3a0333fe35fcdd959b637fcf3cf35e08	had the vanilla ice cream. very good taste and softly served. on the slightly expensive side but worth it. friends had the frozen yogurt which was also awesome. very good option for frozen treats. we were a group of 10 and they were very accommodating. good service.
f589c18f63ae7944d76e28e3d5c4f53d85e784b4eaca7a286eec28d491a449fa	cheesecake of all kinds - need i say more! oh ok i will! this is quite a dessert place on the edinburgh scene and it was badly needed. it adds a strong touch of class and elegance to the city (not that it needed any moire) and just brings total indulgence to it. it is really quite trendy - wear your good tights when you come here! as i said, desserts all ready to go. my heart is yours missoni!
ca4330d5becac6bae4721494a80316f00d1f1f3a3b80776947a679ad3a3a1888	this is bad dessert... as in don't eat here. the ice cream was warm and melted on the plate. the flan was separated from its bottom foil
7ac62d6ebe7adb7d24a9d216efa3677bb3d34209f0302061941475de9b8b7192	after about 15 minutes of eating vanilla ice cream at this ice cream bar i started getting horrible cramps and soon after diarrea. my date started throwing up. i got a bit worried about it and after doing a quick search online i discovered that this ice cream shop got a lot of people sick in the u.s. i'm just praying i did not get anything serious. i am definitely never ever eating at this ice cream shop ever again.
e3e8669b9d64616828379ee393453f1c603805fd507b841d4783566bbbe33c8a	this is our go to spot for fresh baked pies. cherry pie is good, apple pie is great, cookies are quick and tasty and prices are reasonable:
ddc0ca36b27478478380d9e505ff0ac06b61cf544051740ef75b085d84a51810	i am shocked this place does not have more reviews. truly a hidden gem for sweet treats in las vegas. easily the best desserts in las vegas. i come here at least once a week. i always order the butter pecan ice cream which comes with 3 scoops (caramel sauce), chocolate chips and a drink. all for $3.99. sweeties delivers on taste and the prices can't be beat.
7ea5638888741ba9551af92985a9920b9826aef090dcd2cc8100b0550a5674e3	the location isn't the safest unfortunately. the only thing i liked was that they give you hot chocolate instead of tea or soda. the carrot cake had no real carrots which sucked because it's the best part - and we were not told that when we ordered it.
baa8402a8edd3d27e362ba55d85a6576deb446bfee746e31c139542b5e82e4bc	i had the creamy coconut cake with vanilla ice cream. every time the sweets and the staff are awesome!
88f33ac106824640e95fe730dfc1bb82def716b8f0d2a177e8f67ac96df9d9df	when ever i visit, i make it a point to stop by the candy sho[ for some delicious ice cream, never disappoints. dessert time to go orers is really busy so be pateint.
f18941c9a43bf5942bfdf79ab6201a1f494091494d0e8dc68c54aa23c005c90f	so my wife and i were with our daughter and we were all starving, looking for an indulgent place to get a sweet treat or some dessert, and remembered that we'd previously enjoyed eating at true food. we took the drive to the borgata and found out that true food had been closed and replaced with fontana di amore. what did we expect from the new place... actually nothing. we were just excited that they had gelato.
8a378b6c3e0b7284015e15347eb39813dfe05316e75f9b162d08a84cbb1f34a0	apple pie is great, as are most things to eat here, including the pecan pie!
abbf7d8ceda40edaec2ab8aeb53c25866609f10f601be856ff6d56aa83717b10	average desserts. not the best service, ok snacks, nothing spectacular. stay with their cookies and vanilla milkshake if you don't want to be too adventerous. all the other desserts i've tried cheesecake, bubble tea, brownies, peanut butter cups) were disappointing.
90d046e0df8b82dfe540d1a22cb53c71981eda659177b5418f02e4a3e259554f	what this restaurant lacks in size it sure makes up for it in flavor. the tres leches cake is worth going all the way to mexico and fighting the gangs there for.
338c36564882d72aa71b5bdd6a662d47e6f1cf7d9e4b13dd732b5b4de1fe71dc	strawberry cheescake at the cheesecake factory? yes. is it legit? yes. will i return. yes. wasnt it expensive? who cares * must order more cheesecake.
65e1c170843dadf57de14bdfbdfa2511f512aa1b87f44a1e83edc441a9f2f6ea	great ice cream parlor.... i've been to eat ice cream many times and i felt right back in sweet tooth mode. banana split was great, waffle cones were perfect and the cookies and cream espresso coffee hit the spot.... sprinkles and hot fudge where the best i've had in the states. highly recommend this dessert and i will become a regular
efae231bb7779199248e50d14736d532d895df7ab6b2fa9b7d014e58696c9ee0	moved to the charlotte area from california and i'm still looking for good desserts. figured i'd give 3 amigos a try based on yelp reviews. very nice staff and menu with a decent variety. their ice cream has lots of flavor and is very mild. i ordered their ice cream sandwiches. it was good, not great. after a few bites though, there was the biggest cockroach i've ever seen crawling on the wall. that definitely killed my appetite.
bfe574a43c5f1911f7135e088062aeecc4b7a1234db14beb76431aa7476bd98d	great mexican resturant in middle of the city if nowhere! i like their fajitas! also their lingua is really good. absolute taste with energy.
1a7d23d58c471615251ba1dd38bf0ff135227b5b68d2227ffaaab749c1a0ad12	awesome little ice cream place. my boyfriend and i decided to give this place a go on a wednesday night. i got a banana split with nuts and hot fudge and jimmies. reminds me a of cute little ice cream parlor.
31387bb26cfdd9a4989cf104df73aa18c464cfb4ae18e8b3809202dbf8d9cb67	terrible services. very rude waiters. and the apple pies were poor quality. for those who can differentiate great and sloppy pie, i cant recommend . the price not that cheap either,
13d3bda6ee2c214d843c07dcffcc06dcf8b708ba5043d2a5dca589197cd9224b	i love the cheesecake and brownie combo. summer special with 2 cups of coffee for 20. you can't beat it! fast service and fresh food
278254d673b5cd0be5c390a3b2490fbe615fdbf1b1efb8c31c01dca92bba55d6	a mexican suburban shopping mall with amazingly cooked deliciously cooked meals, the only thing wrong with this place is that they need more places! reasonably priced and guaranteed quality, recommended for each layer although the periphery is quite easy to visit
b6b55a96e1682de16dafb403403be21a320102d3ff549d50cbb1392ea3bb473c	been here a bunch of times. its very comforting and the fresh-baked pies are always good. good baked goods selection and attentive staff. apple pie and ice cream tonight!

36015fa96703c224187a3577ff1ce8312bc33179d0f61fd9207bdd879c2e76d1	excellent.. simple cake menu done well one of the best tasting chocolate coatings i've had. i added battenberg cake (light sponge cake with the pieces covered in jam) and had a small bowl of gingerbread cookies.
003bb0623b0d5b531526f7335b64d76413e3ff62669fdc257285c7081e5bdbf1	i love this place for some churros and chocolate. us four went and split the sweets and a pitcher of the cinnamon-spiced churro and had a fabulous time. the dates stuffed with chocolate almonds, wrapped in jelly and deep-fried are life-changing, of course.
081a61b2b6932bd95edcd70dfb0fe0324610793bc2527d3913e1311b9411afc2	wow and wow!! pleasant clean friendly staff and the hot fudge sundaes are amazing!!! my friend got the carrot cake with fresh cream cheese icing!! the cake was fluffy
080700438552dac5a7a40a74ec36889e593e34304e099431becf9037ba3bef9c	we get takeout from chocolate factory every week. their food is consistently great and reasonably priced and also they have the best cakes i have ever tried. our favorites include lava cake and the tiramisu.if you're looking for a desert that will melt in your mouth, this is the place.

ca9adae48c794fe177eeacd15271dbe763698459b3d46c13df737e6a80717678	best fried ice cream in nc, maybe the us. an unqualified, enthusiastic 5 stars. don't even ask about calories or cholesterol. you ain't coming to price's for your health - just for the best ice cream and fried oreos anywhere, at any price.
8154a0adcf78d7df27393ffec77a9f0c103b2668f1b9070a46e693b54596dc70	terrific place! tons of new dessert items on the menu. i got dragged in off the street by a little spitfire of a server, named anna. she promised delicious fried ice cream and brownies, and the chef delivered! great dessert place!
fa651c2ef5c4a22eb5e7d436a3724a15d7b5d0f569384987b55e376dffe4b7b7	overpriced and skimpy scoops. root beer float probably has about a tablespoon of ice cream. the dessert was not even decorative or fancy. it was poorly made, i don't why it costs so much

ff1d33083c252a503f97b9e0f3395693a07c9791bc51f172da6169f9c9a05485	this place was pretty good! it reminds me of roberto's same layout and everything just a different name! the only thing i noticed is that it is a little pricey but the ice cream is good quality. so it's not bad if you're in the mood for great dessert foods

ea0b8273d791a090ea80ba2eebea5adcead479f8cc98c6628ec5d7bd76f85886	the oreo and chocolate chip ice cream cake was awesome! great milkshakes and boba selection, need i say more???
71a0a77639eba3f289394aa1104bcc37a44d61a66985e2421c1abb1cd32208df	i stopped by here because it's attached to the bluegreen resort next door. it's a nice quick place to grab fruit pastries, chocolate and peanut butter cakes, ice cream sundaes, parfaits, and warm chocolate chip and oatmeal cookies. they have everything available, especially because it's so roomy and there aren't many people around. it's tough to get to by taxi, but if you're driving, it's a nice place to pick up some desserts. the employees were super nice and kept checking to see if i needed help with anything.
8866d5ee0a5e79d6c1a82c2004abeaf245b28edfaa336d482bb0eda74567fd7b	same owner as the ice cream parlor stall in the galleria plaza. with the higher prices, was expecting better quality, but unfortunately the ice cream tastes the same as the food court. so many better ice cream parlors nearby (some with more toppings, more flavors, better prices, etc...). tried once and won't be back for any more ever again. bad ice cream!
266e5d26b0d1363fe764c5100a4f2201a8c0e7bd48ffbb372849b9e7b0fdbe65	this is one of the best places for dessert in champaign. i had the carrot cake and the homemade ice creams. incredible way to end the meal. can't wait to go back!

a0d223a80ef4fa3c62aa3e896e87123bd211ba13a32f023a981773ade1e4522d	input review: the longest wait i ever had in a bell or anything else fast food of the common fact. simple meals, simple, yet introspective messages to do? now the excuse of a fast food restaurant. but other foods when serviced was niche and healthy. it always happens in the restorations that offer fast food because there are many people

d3e65070e2be051641ac10ea0e7d0fe892ef9a1d18c15add1c161aaa094efaf8	really liked this ice cream sundae place. they have the best hot fudge sauce in mesa. very sweet and delicious like most ice cream shops. 1.70 per scoop or you can get a full hot fudge sundae for $16. i wish they could make a half cone for 2 people. other than that if you like ice cream this place is really good.
3177e518a874827617babef40a6adfff94a09f74033722829c1474fa1026bd9d	it appears this place finally closed. they had great tiramisu and the panna cotta was simply amazing! there's now a sign up saying there's a filiberto's coming soon. i wish another restaurant with great desserts would open up there instead of filiberto's.
