1df88136e238ee14e3ca13e0eac3190fbc5202f4b27c974f9144aa7b6a6407d4	the best asian place hands down! they always have a ton of food with great asian flavor that change often! i personally love the dumpling sauce! they have a great selection of sauces too! then when you are ready to check out, you spend a lot less than any of the other asian restaurants in town! at competitors you end up paying a lot more per person! at this place, you spend $5-6 less! the staff is always friendly and tolerate the kids well. my family and i love this place!

91fb800b44edec2a7894eb129e13a57b7d1fcc2725fbcc42d675364f25371cb1	yummy dumplings and a wide selection of soups like hot & sour, and egg drop soups! the egg rolls are very crisp and the prices are low, so it is nice to pick up some dumplings for the house or workplace at a decent cost. the employees were very helpful and polite, and they also gave me free chop sticks to use.
4149f26f4d16c3f7dc66058969988ae9135884284874a5449cc5fc15682303d5	nothing like a good sushi after a ball game or night out, and there is no other sushi like mings. the selection is what brings you here.
33dc31b4d79e487588d52e483cbceb254ec8589851ded11ccac1ac488d446afe	i have never really been impressed with hong kong market. i find them to be pricey and lack variety. i have had hit-or-miss luck with finding bean sprouts. i guess i might be happier if i ate fish and eel.  the bok choy and daikon are always sold out, at least the it's is close by.
a647864085494254b34346c94ac60958ae2352a252943cd3e3f4fc6bfc1fde54	we are regulars here, my and my husband just gorge on these freaking delicious and juicy pork dumplings!! we loved it.

cd9a4f421a26b5373d5490bd68d42af11b2661ebe150e45420d6f8c3a99aa2c7	very cool place in downtown montreal to get some tea and sushi. just about everything is made from fresh fish. you can't go wrong with one of the nigiri or maki combos. and the choices of the natural sushi rolls is fantastic. definitely a great place to either pop in and grab something to go or just to hang out on the outside terrace and people watch and enjoy a really tasty and not so bad for you treat.
d8470e336a0fc477982a8fa8970d573d28d7106e65d28fd1cefae3956f7ee15f	oph has some of the best authentic pork dumplings around. if you go on a saturday or sunday morning  you'll probably have to wait for a seat because it's so busy, but it's well worth it for the delicious and fresh dumplings!

67c109877abff3519c88934a69ed7142801973a3ce02b9a46021ad0c57e46e9b	my friend recommended the sweet and sour pork and chinese pork varieties, and i was really impressed. the sweet and sour sauce was so tangy and the latter tasted exactly like a vintage chinese pork . i also tried the fried rice and tempura, and it was great. the tables could use some cleaning, otherwise it's a great place to hang around.
77006f83ab376849cd6c964229975f56d6aae97c6d1860a40ec9b57afb4f274c	huge selection of noodles, sauces and beverages. store is very clean and well organized so it's easy to find what you want. prices were average so nothing outrageous. they have a nice selection of authentic imported brands but could not buy many drinks cold so you would have to chill it before drinking.
b4e8e09abdc17abce32d76dd5142d5d4e65d76c463ee2c9cc90e90da72984cf0	i think this is the best sushi in arizona, i got to japsn all the time so i had some great sushi and i think mings is just as good.

e9caf044c18a0813cb74bfc3f1f2c74271a9b3de693d68c63dc391412832287a	by far the best korean kimchi in town imo. it has sweet and sour kimchi! so good! they have tons of other crazy flavors too, like tangy kimchi to horseradish kimchi, you can't go wrong at this place.

e1fb9eb3f15cb16846b1731c74c49d9819066057f20eff738205d6cab4d312b5	great food! awesome home in the wall feel. the restaurant is counter service with a menu mostly in japanese. order the miso ramen (i got pork with extra noodles) they are amazing. the tonkatsu ramen was also great. the shoyu ramen was okay, but overshadowed by the other two things i ordered.

f38bd7308c63749badb2114f2d35af05b1b5a8e412a8d68d2acd1eaea4e5f783	typical panda express restaurant. i prefer this place over qdoba any day because of their awesome-sized sushi rolls and tasty ramen. however, i wish this franchise supported the military and offered a discount to the vets. cost to eat there gets pricey w / my appetite, but still enjoyable to eat once in a blue moon.
0560f6f63491a62d7e959cbbc22735755aa6dac07bf55ea2fe7fa97152fb9fb3	whenever i have out of town friends, i bring them to tamba my favorite asian restaurant. i love the oriental furniture and the food! they have so many noodle dishes to choose from. they even have a sushi chief on staff. pretty great prices also. very friendly staff, spacious and tucked away. also the nearby parking is just amazing!

05e3482aef24e30a8b984a761fe7fef43e7828aa36cee32438f6c9ebc2df6241	just awful. so called spring roll was cold and bland....jump a lump of meat and vegetables in a egg noodle wrapper. reminded me of frozen chinese food but worse.
57cbce1ad9b3d00b75bd6c496ffa32772f94a249d589030ede858e9a6b56f737	it's maggiano's, of course it is good, just like the location in tokyo and the one by kyoto. they have some of the best stuffed gyoza and miso ramen among other great sushi and fish dishes. never gone wrong on anything i have ordered, chicken ramen, tempura, etc. if you have room try the matcha cookies, so good.
d27b8b57b1c810cfbfd1862587de56edecf921a14ea3e41758e1e6c7d9413409	this place has great chinese drop-egg miso soup with a variety of flavors and amazing service. the owner of this business should be very happy with the positive outcome and their awesome employees. i suggest you try the sweet and sour pork flavor!
2e2cec0fccbbcbe165974340d88393589a1d6878637aac5011f8cdfb9d271306	can't stand the smell. come to mings all the time, they were remodeling and something isn't right, smells like sewer. i think they have plumping issue.
b6bbd9a0ec629083ade8475f67a1fb000f61fc375ca6aa06b77d9c94daaa2056	choose great wall's fried rice with pork and shrimp lo mein, it was amazing!

927add1206e64cc07f14597185e72882e06b580eff6fcb7f55a0bfdd20eaddf8	the rice and sushi is delish i order it everytime i go in along with rice balls, the food is always made fresh to order and service is great.
97f9f40d72917f6a8a7143d88055f19be00d747c7322cb8f746ae1d3d6028be7	moving from the paradise valley area over to arrowhead we were excited to try the chompies on the west side. unfortunately we were disappointed. we got the chicken gyoza and the dumpling was stale and old. the meat was dry and not worth the 12.00 for the gyoza. also the tempura shrimp were cold. really subpar japanese food. we won't be going back.
695eb135698860768287bb6754572e19669a2fc20d487005920cfdda99f4dfb2	it was fantastic! had the dumplings and chicken which had half sweet and sour chicken and my companion had sweet and tangy chicken. both flavors were outstanding and the dumplings were very fresh and juicy. i would drive to waxhaw just for this again.
b2bd9efeb946722e8ae27ec012237c084ae3c0a29ab9021d9c7fd40bc79bc4dc	walked in and i was greeted immediately by friendly staff. i ordered a banana roll, which had cinnamon swirl filling. the girl was helpful and kept letting me try out all the different types of rolls. i had a black sesame roll that was amazing!
21657b8e442359698100a4ea11171073f68851dffb4e57a009d5f7cc2f48b43e	this place was delicious. the food is great portions and prices were right, paul and ming are the nicest. we will be back, 10 starts not 5. the sushi and prok roll was amazing. can't wait to be back in vegas.
83c510c6a7e62c6d701aaac7e06327263acb735209a6c5a879813f4b20581828	my family and i had the opportunity to try the dumplings for lunch during our recent trip to p f changs and we all thoroughly enjoyed it. the selection of fried rice dishes was abundant. there was something for everyone. my daughter enjoyed the hot & sour soup and i was extremely pleased with my shrimp fried rice. the service was also top notch, and i highly recommend this buffet.
9c6b909c6d13cd6a65859879188627dd7ffff7738821094b991e6402a803b476	just had the shrimp and snow peas with a side of sushi. best lunch i've had. we will be back!

77843073c2f6d6c0993679db350b3594b6ddf0468c772700cb54e1bfdf48335c	my review is simple. wong's is a straight up nasty restaurant. please avoid this place and spend your money elsewhere. if you are in the mood for fried rice i would recommend chang's that is close by. if you want a dumpling go to nang's. if you want sushi go to sushi emporium. all are close by
b0f996cb55ec2714c237add8716405446ddc70974e582bfc4f262cf78394874c	we arrived soon after they opened to have some umeshu and hopefully a peek at the sushi chef at work. the plum wine was nice and the itamae friendly and knowledgeable. he let me wander the restaurant to see the tank of unagi, since the folks dining had not yet arrived. it really was kawaii in there!
97fe193fda8628ac9a65066ccff26d39de92fb8d4365aedacf5479b621135c3d	i've never had a dish i don't like at tanaka's. the sweet and sour pork and chicken dumplings are always great. i even had a whole fried tuna with rice once, and it was exceptional, considering madison is not a coastal city.

ff8f0577cf80137727b86f2c72aeb40290b31cbc3f62cb3ddd3afb446e6ba398	i had some of the best dumplings that have ever graced my mouth here. also, the sweet and sour sauce is to die for. every time i am here i debate whether i should buy a large container of sweet and sour sauce to eat with a spoon until i die of happiness, yum!

855854c3fc897a7640843e748c5831711aaaf24b550407866977db231c31009b	so amazing! the service is incredible and the food is so great! my favorite is the sesame chicken. definitely try their soy sauce. prices are very great. have tried loads of locations and all have been great. will be back!
46be69e272437690471d14d42340855202036b6d676016ba62f82f2123be3e4e	the food and service was amazing, prices were extraordinary. had only japanese dishes, miso ramen and shrimp tempura with soy sauce. the shrimp tempura were probably the best i've had in a restaurant. loses a star for reeking of cigarette smoke. definitely worth it though.
807f0b4112c380e0edd06b6d5dd51c5e139d0d247823828843bfc1bba22cd88f	ok, i didn't retry the sushi meat yet, which got a bad review, but i am trying other japanse favs on the menu. sushi with soy sauce, delicious.
ea99320b1e9b9f79ee124c5ad9e8440a1e698210f4cbea89bac7c1e87827f4c6	i knew this chinese restaurant when it was a two story staple on state street. the new location isn't the same, but the dumplings are still wonderful. big servings of hot & sour soup, and the perfect chinese restaurant atmosphere. my girlfriends and i hit it up when we are craving some teriyaki chicken or lo mein. we love the shrimp fried rice and egg rolls. the egg rolls are also fantastic, but you have to buy them seperately. my mouth is watering thinking about those dumplings. 5 stars.
6ffcfba9bbe8f845b967ee620cd22d712121cded93be16ccfa556fc63a100e28	hello friends, it's analynn... come on out and try chompie's amazingly fresh asian food. homemade dumplings, soups and the best shrimp with sha-cha sauce you've ever eaten. word of advice when you order make sure you order half an entree or you will need a ladder to reach the top because the portions are so enormous. it is much better to order several different entrees and share with everyone so each person can get a little taste of everything. enjoy friends!
8c6ba725d8dbcf716a6727a90e9aefa878dbaa2c23dc6605b9e51d376daa37e1	tried the beef vermicelli combo with an eggroll. excellent. hard to pick a favorite combo. not sure what additional ingredients are in the eggroll, but great flavor. sweat and sour sauce makes my head explode, so they are perfectly rolled.
24f544faaef859560d89b477e2b511c57834d26241e63917575eed94f5b94402	i really like this place because, the sushi , the sake, pork,and entress can be pretty costly which is why 4 stars.
f9933e8c31dec103e00fce938b2382fd4ca05e2cab9188e6b0b8a2430b4f2e33	they have the best teriyaki chicken! it's like i'm sayin. lo mien noodles! fried rice, check! duck sauce for that white rice! correct change? nope!
7c595c54d648c13362256fb4ecd6139f9c886331a56ca36ff5e237bbc579c989	awesome wagashi and delicious moon cakes and red bean steam buns... and great service it was a great pleasure in meeting anat the baker for our wedding cake...
a105c874f6304ce2a4f7fa6f822bd4797a1baf7bc3f292365aa182d523f19b75	this place is trully a 5 star place in quality of ramen, best miso ramen ever!. the best ramen in town, it beats rudy's, can't stop smoking, the whole food's ramen section and lucilles. this is the authentic japanese ramen. the owner serves and cooks the ramen noodles himself. as a tip, come in for lunch before 11 am!
bc1f168be8436c84dcd3b8eb43778c00d0910c667dbd8a5b6b989dbb65b13631	sushi is good, i like them better than panda express. this one is busy and i love the soda machine.
eda079a49b82958dd91657ed525d66e70de5260b0c3c1d090e456694f38c25ee	had dinner here january 2016, wonderful experience overall, delicious, good sushi no complaints from anyone in our group.
10cf54929e94dceb91b312c5a8c0708cf98424081bdd00e605b562d2f8cb73c8	tried this place on the recommendation of yelpers and was not disappointed. started off with the egg flower soup and wontons which was a welcome treat after a day of hikinh. we also polished off our day with some japanese sodas they had- bother were good. we had the mongolian beef and the sweet and sour chicken and were not disappointed. definitely worth a look and we will be back! ps- great specials during the week
11d6b996bc3b361eb4ddb98ee2ceb09c0c2cd174946ae0e5fcbf12cc5ac0ff4f	the edamame, and the pot-stickers are pretty good, we ordered fried wantons that were not my favorite but i normally wouldn't order those so i'll definitely be back to try some lo mien and sushi!
73f067647635017ff247592ab2df6c06acbd650032547eb3a8309efb4b504487	beef pad see ew is the item to get here! make sure to order it with extra chile flakes. chicken laab is a close second.
5248ab6d3197f5c978a26c0c8eadb8a042723ac4df1d57ed16b35bc7e381a9ec	one of the best nights i've ever had in vegas. the different ramen were awesome! pay the 15.00 for vip seating it's worth it! the japanese foods were around 8.00 dollars and they didn't skimp on the soy sauce.
2d674d0c0463b1d0a81d1f4b3ae70141840148421ff42f29c1651b3fbc7e6e9e	2nd best sushi. decent price for a place like bayview

a2766fe60d0dbf7b831af2bc4523c8ef1f2b916d4239004b041034f20c19eb6d	to call this place chinese food is tantamount to treason. ordering process was clunky. not easy to tell pricing -- ended up getting uncharged $4 on my dumpling for things like rice and spring rolls that are standard fare at fast casual chains like panda express or manchu wok. food quality was average -- certainly didn't merit the premium pricing of a $12-14 dollar chow mein. staff was friendly and helpful.
9500804c18c9739ed57e3e0054f951a8667f59a2607fa279978a2831bfa8870d	best chinese food ever, the rice is amazing- just like mings. i love the sushi and rice cakes. i used to be a woo on central die hard but this place has a bigger menu selection. if yu want inexpensive chinese food then this is the place.

359cfaee2bc1658a01165fed7ce538db839f7b07c28b68f4ad25d37fbfb942b8	mongolian beef was boss. nice to find a place that has dumplings just like they do in la where you can find a chinese stand on every corner. will be going back here when i'm back in vegas
65de1e650badfcaf3c1347d7293ce7011c02631aa5845c37d8ba778b930bc051	i love this intimate place. when the work day has been less than kind happy hour is your answer. a great glass of sake, sushi and noodles... casual yet intimate and the food never disappoints.
60774c10833f1c4922969df7aaa7233fe04c6e16deeb0a56a8273d2a13c6be09	i'm not sure it is possible to leave a bad review about a japanese shop. even if you were to have bad service, as soon as you bite into one of those warm, handcrafted, savory ramen noodles, you are in heaven. i had never been to this location until this morning. quick, easy, in and out, smiling staff. i'm happy, and may or may not have almost polished off an bowlful of ramen. thanks japanese restaurant =]
f8de8c90fc9ab5a6bfc33fea13421ee5b6d186c83b596c85374c6e2b3b8306c6	while in vegas, had to hand carry as carry on my sushi but to jacksonville. next closest china house is in youintville...good thing is that they packed them nicely.
1775454fa4180c96f8b8250f23c1ac65a8ee0b606120b1626888544e11705aa1	delicious sushi! i love the food and so do my friends who actually know authentic japanese food. the folks behind the counter are delightful. the only downside is the wait if you come after 11: 30am - but that's because it's so popular because the sushi rolls are so yummy. give it a try.
1cb5df50179f868fa0c4e25fe71b4bf9bbd5c9f0ace093c3ef52675886724807	the service was very quick and tea cup never went empty. the dinner came with three sides. sushi and tempura were amazing. my husband had breakfast and said the onigiri were the best. very reasonable priced.
0c4bc0fc02ec784e79e5036bfff62310b66521243b3ecc7a371b13da0e0766fe	group of guys met the owner at a nearby bar and she invited us down. hooked us up with all the good and even sat down with us to chat. dumplings and eggrols were so good. check out the waterfall bathroom outside and look out for luther.
590b7463168ded160c301ea323e8cac3380d159c3a8060e5d10eb45ff41e4632	there was a clean and friendly atmosphere here. the coffee was great along with a fresh dumpling roll and rice..definitely a place to come for coffee and asian breakfast before a long days work.
0b8f975b54c5dbce0d6178478be807b899867217cde064f7bb2538fa0279ba12	excellent japanese food and service in a down home, welcoming spot. very good miso ramen at a fair price. will definitely return.
8e14630ee081c9d9ba20ddf4468ab5bf0704ed0c8b1191e06e443af170611413	i've been to the chinese restaurant at market square several times. i like the lo mein and the teriyaki chicken. they include egg rolls and hot and sour soup with your order if you are dining in. i like this chinese restaurant much more than chains like panda express, maybe because the dumplings are much better. service has always been friendly, i will return.
6595913fbd03078d4d095fd6031ef0add8eacb809e3cefbf8c0c2cebf7eee697	guadalajara is one of the most authentic asian restaurants in phx. portions large to share or take home; everything on the menu is delicious. you will not be disappointed. the restaurant is spacious; however on week-ends expect to wait inside or outside for a table.
d8a542ff04e1e25c56e850c1d47e4f5f5b467606dd3a03906030fd279199314b	what a novel concept. a chinese restaurant located at the ford car dealership. the dim sum and dumplings were amazing. we would definitely come back on our next visit to vegas

47cee8beb6d46dd52a234e34fb3c38717db08c6a3fe40a7f8f2c47eb58ce8937	awesome staff, great fresh rice for a discounted price. nice environment and amazing selection.

a34923d87213e67457f565da3e71c9d918c8902144702e2c20e483db595885cb	this place is the bomb! not only is the food amazing, but the sticky rice is freaking off the chain! great customer service, and a huge selection of great pho dishes. fernando will hook you up, great dude!
9c1ff63d3f399165df1f6f0b519eadbde31b66ef91ddde290a75439fce61b79e	been going to mings for many years now and still have the best sushi bar. everything is freshly made and many trips to rocky point,
fa651c2ef5c4a22eb5e7d436a3724a15d7b5d0f569384987b55e376dffe4b7b7	overpriced and skimpy servings. the hot & sour soup was probably just a tablespoon, and the fried rice had no additional toppings.
5e781a17a04ec1a8cfd827eeda8686179b53f319eb18aa6a31ff9849fc431d08	it's the bomb.com never disappoints on their sesame chicken go to pho place happy all the time

1e220d84f1054a066efd97a7acf3efe6be7f80f8f7429a551cbc4e29fb2a5366	this is a fun store to look around in, but the prices are entirely too high. you can find similar products for better prices on chinese websites. the only thing i've ever purchased out of there have been unusual fun food items for christmas gifts. fun store, but not worth the high prices.
7f46dd3434296371db1d0b9392afe6328dd6cf36ac4f1a5d6d99662f933dcf06	i love the layout of this sushi place, what you want to see when entering a msgic land of sushi goodness, such a great variety of sushi and sake,

0010291e9156aac3440602eaa60aa93a9f227da31e5ce7a6fb7dc2c03f918e36	nothing special about this place. i ordered the miso ramen. ramen noodles itself was tasty and would have been special if the ramen broth and pork slices didnt cover up all of its flavor. my friend ordered the salmon nigiri but they forgot to put all the soy sauce and sushi vinegar on the sushi. everything was also way too sweet.
45a60607d9188bee61506483e5eb34539ad0c969c1cad6bc9f0083bb7c3f0ae5	it is a changs buffet, and just like every other buffet out there. expect the service is always above standard, which i truly love.

5973b2462b12d6fab36637e079800c522c09f458dbe2a0eb0b6e228d5a623fd6	great service, employees extremely friendly. charles especially. wagashi are so delicious. good for gifts, especially the different japanese green teas.

5a9481398e78847a4712f16e79c3b73cefe8520059ee863ad3801ad2fa5c8caf	went to the one on central. dumplings / sauce average, eggrolls average, mango soda decent, slow unfriendly service, decor ok. not sure i'd go back, nothing special about this place.
ead897c41feafaeaecfb772e7523c1ef39ad795c5fc48f0ddc5d4739c3c6827f	a great new korean menu. good food and the service was excellent too. we need more neighborhood places like liang's.

2d506bd8f70c2322a576a7d43fdecf116023b96c452ac016acfa82269de6be5c	what an excellent find for this tourist couple! my wife and i both love asian food and this place was really good. i had the orange chicken. she ordered teriyaki chicken and a side of california rolls. all the food was very good and flavorful. the sushi had a really nice tangy taste to it. wife's only critique was that the pieces of meat could have been cut up much smaller. we are always glad to find a nice restaurant off the strip and away from the casinos.
18103f4dc596e202188b3440c81be40331d955c961da94eec90b066832d39643	best location hands down! makes the sushi taco with duck sauce. must remember to request soy. no lettuce ever as it robs all the flavor from the sushi
641462ffece93c0aa84ce4001b49c2a243a65a3b75f536ecfc44879366864307	being from san diego and having spent a lot of time in japan, this ramen are about as authentic as you can find. i'm pretty sure they are horrible for you, but they're ramen... what do you expect? what i like is that everything is made to order. it doesn't sit under a heat lamp getting all dried out and rubbery. the noodles are hand made right in front of you. oh... if they only sold tonkatsu ramen... one can only wish.
7fad0d64cc3beeb4678ebbd23031d75d6993471002a1da0ba12cf064bb7e08f8	this place sucks, i have given it many tries and disappointed every time. i received sushi that sat on the plate until rubber. the pork tastes like its out of a can,the pork fried rice is cardboard.
a9e5dbcc2e3455e5639ba137c34ac75cf0f5c3627588f61f01a8a039d72f6c80	i'm writing this review as i'm eating my hainan noodles with pork dumplings. it's soo good. i also got the ground beef egg-drop soup. that was also soo good. definitely recommend this place if you want something low cost and chinese in vegas!

2982c705551b68980160fc27756d53ddb50e6f5fa24b720afbc4f113fd7d8e34	best sushi in phoenix! i love mi amigo's! the tempura and soy sauce are always fresh and there's always plenty of it on your table. i tried almost everything and it's all good. but my favorite is the miso ramen or mini gyoza platter - so delicious!
4d60e04ed20ab1a88522913d550188b71980e6df8dc776ffe91c4903c55fa6f3	tasty food! we had the chicken ramen with pork gyoza. the chicken ramen was spiced just enough so that the taste was not masked. the gyoza were soft and tasty. the service was good, with two waiters coming to check on us.
edd358ece52c6a840ee7452a314210ac40fd7f72e404db5250ce90cf89f86b37	i'm so glad we found chang's chicken. we had our chicken delivered and our delivery person thomas arrived right on time with a piping hot chicken stir fry. we ordered the sweet and sour stir fry with natto  and it tasted so good!! we finally found our go to chinese place. thank you chang's!

b2e0eba077005166075dad00f916e8ef632d87ef61d5fcd0b933974fed20bb2b	they had delicious cucumber salad and rice noodles. the pad thai was perfect. i had to eat here by myself cause my wife hates thai.
3a3c0c80e715d36d90f864bd89856a08fd1a9f04a8e098c5ae139dcce568c6e0	average tasting ramen. not enough noodles relative to the amount of pork that is stacked on top. i think that the overdone noodles amount takes away from the ramen as a whole. however, i must say that i love the look of the tonkatsu ramen.
6b27f6cb800a332d998953d96c2e4bed0bc52e767a98b2bd5e18e74483decfca	one of the best sushi platter i have had in years. they call it nihon platter. it's amazing. please try it.
3ae293bd963dff9fb8c7d36a4c9ea8ff851a916f2fa801f669e11b7db0b72808	i absolutely love  this place. the fried rice is great, especially with the orange chicken. the service is very fast and friendly. the house special with two sides is good and the drinks are fantastic. parking lot is clean as well as the inside of the restaurant. i'm getting hungry for asian food as i write this review.
007b54c9365c200411766bfda73f0159c1cbbe45861b733b77ec5ca80d3d91ed	you know what i love about mings? the patio is dog frinedly. we love to go there on saturday afternoon and drink sake, sushi and enjoy the cool weather.
218e65fa06d9ab5aa096af16ab5cea75b2321b9a4678e217bccafeab25d3a0c1	i would recommend this to anyone who like japanese noodles and sushi very clean and the food is excellent.
bc1b31d56040bab1e26cf65d4971e502e05ca34df14dc16f23c480c72b2c1e64	best sushi ever....i didnt even know this place existed until this past weekend, their sushi are amazing, i usually don't eat sushi cause its sweet.
c0de765d7f2b501143ec51b885922dca8ac732f8df987ae2f9a3b82ebc3eb4a9	be still my ramen loving heart. i've never found a japanese ramen joint that makes japanese like ramen for the dairy free folks. i must return for their gyoza
ce47653616d616c979ef49d35350fe9f47f5c51ba2f8301f7894db5a11ccc0ce	our spot for late night sushi in miami, good food. they have a great fried duck and they are always open.
28def8110a6ed3b5b2aa8eeb0f2221a2d78e2596c33ee7b76a989577fc37795f	i come here for the sushi once a week and now they are gone, bring them back,
658ee465b617a6c6490904ec83904f1fa5cf4d4d82404cd47cfea61fddeb8e25	this place had great service! i split my sushi and rice soup flavors between sweet, tangy and sour and was not disappointed.
c616354f44ef7c868ca815cbc4161d5b4e11afcdc544b5c7268b3ba7d520c8a5	this restaurant was pretty good. we had nearly everything on the menu. the onigiri were delicious. the soy sauce was the right consistency and the tempura was crispy and well seasoned. the fish were tender. the chicken was crispy and seasoned. the matcha and red bean buns were sweet and delicious. you really can't go wrong with the sencha. our waitress, toni was really good and made our experience even better. i'd recommend it if you want good japanese food.,
d1664cc5240cd581445f8921544bc198971d0e28388ef8c186f1d8817ef75313	great food for a chinese spot with a bar, decent sake selection and a very nice staff. i actually go quite often.
6d9cff39a63d63d1059c53d266dbe6b3e54e8dbff93ee1cd627e7bcd205e3b8b	best thai iced coffee! it's so creamy, like a coffee flavored smoothie. i'm not normally a coffee fan, but this was so good that i can't wait to go back again. not that impressed by the rest of the meal, compared with the amazing thai iced coffee!
e0013e879990bd4fa8230e32a6186b52a3c5882773ae2b2fa8d6c96a70b966a0	i am a regular for their chinese port, which is the best. as well as their sushi roll. their duck is good also. it it a little spicy for me but the sauce is great.
6a7667ab3cdc1ddacefafcf85d33a14ef08553cb5f66f1f82ae62ec2ea03dc10	it's really hard for me to actually like a sushi place more than sushi land. this sushi place has definitely topped that lol. really good sushi always super tasty. they rotate flavored on a regular basis thumbs up! the atmosphere of this place is really cool and hipster! if you're in the area and craving something japanese stop by!
bcf5ed4fd9a1833152170d72136fdcf27923da1ad976c1cc85147947cd892261	loved this lil local restaurant!! amazing peanut chicken and fresh brewed tea.
c2e628f335328a007064fbf58c4c8edc6094ff92dd03b2738755fa8ce5ef0661	china house was a surprise. the sushi was declicious and the sake amazing. ming the owner is very nice and very helpful. one of my favorite dinner spots.
839f5b56f49a38fd36ad3832130fc0e87cb07c92ea470088e787f0b4acebb62c	the server remembered us by name and when we did get our food it was nice and warm i will go back to this pho soup shop as much as possible.
786f750835601a4f05aa366c885948a9cdad4c34ad3573dc29760b78c0ab2f23	sushi is huge and amazing, fresh sushi goodness, we love it there, super friendly people and damn good sushi.
329a03d462bcc9b1961bda391e0349e0b6980e18f5653a3cc8acca9694b5a76b	this is always a great place to grab a sushi wrap and a coffee before school at univ. i suggest you try the steamed sushi and rice bagel sandwich.
a209ed8554cc114e079d938f6a801535479dd0642af3d721b9fa7fbe37e27912	for many years, i was resistant to the idea of fish stir fry. little did i know what i was missing. 8 years ago, i decided to try it at a new chinese place and i've never looked back! on this particular visit, i redeemed my free birthday meal which is a perk of signing up for their email notifications. consistently good food every time i visit!
9f30339913905ac98d4134430b28e0dbe6c26102134df4ae52f3ee66483bfc77	my fiance and i went to mings while in cali for the weekend, it was located right by our hotel. the food was good, i ordered a dragon roll and i was really impressed. if you are staying at the double tree hotel i cali try mings,
766f3a9624ae97ee72a50ac9f51e419b2ed97baa4d10fa6547e709a2e9d7ce99	seriously some of the best japanese food i've had in a while. go for happy hour and don't let the word "chīsai" make you order more than one - the servings are huge. the sushi sampler is worth it - but is literally enough sushi and soy sauce for 4. the mushroom and miso ramen are amazing.
adaae3aa1bd598dbdf58d19798f5e05fbc78760462a9fab787b5508b4bd84064	i ordered the sushi, the sake special and rice for breakfast. the sake special and sushi were delicious, the rice...well, they were bland and dry. our waiter was dressed as a warrior. the helmet was pretty cool.
6d125cbfc7603ccaa9e2b01abc6e2f65459fa230dec3ea0e6644e8ef784124c3	get to mings, order the duck and prepare for something completely unexpected, go ahead i'll wait.
d5d40142cbbb96aad3cf91ae8faf3ff203f0b90fdf9086f5c42c49c563d58c32	there really isn't anything special about this chinese restaurant. your run of the mill fried rice and egg rolls are better than this place's. i have been here twice now and am willing to drive the extra 2 miles to the dumpling place over on bell road. if you have had real chinese food you will be a bit disappointed in the bland menu and the lack of hot and sour soup, and that they use forks instead of chopsticks.
ee6f50b27e494da032c2a0682cb380b5a8f46015a9495d6c20029634f93e37eb	a good asian restaurant, but, a little overrated in my opinion. more of a cult following than not, dumplings did not live up to the hype.
1c55a2016121b42fb0c86e49dcf3891a5461dcfb9dcf2a00aa9e44a7da8ae443	beautiful ramen creations that taste great too! the best ramen we've found in vegas with very nice shop and seating too.
b93e7e98c20a15cf4933e40f91adabbcd9d693b5aab16bb7ff54b7ae36cd5947	got 3 sushi with soy suace and one tempura with shrimp and veggie to go. you can sit down here but we didn't have time do we got our good to go. all the tempura were great and the sushi rolls were good as well. the tempura had loads of shrimp inside. the pork in the ramen was a thick slab of pork. great tempura. easy parking which helps too.
183aa0e9fe8bdd1e89347fde17eb7b228f1a4de17e5dd8a4c60731e7c80d8127	never disappoints, sushi is always fresh no matter what time of day best sushi in the valley.
eb6e3f7f14a3a8d0da453c33f635642f7adec304c9f34792b70ab565cf0ea48a	the place is relaxing the japanese sake that are available are good. friendly service makes this place a +
9cb60b096e453411df8ece6eb3572197ac5f052684184419935ae507c48af12f	p. f. chang's has the best fried rice ever, i love how good it tastes with the soy sauce. they are open late, and what is better than their egg rolls and dumplings?
25f8b7706a7bc8046f347dab56e4534c829c5ca31b8adcf0d6f3988b60ba181d	finally, an authentically japanese restaurant in the south hills! absolutely awesome, good for you food. the shrimp nigiri is fabulous!
cba5b264ad5c18cdb149f85c64de60ae3a0333fe35fcdd959b637fcf3cf35e08	had the pad thai and the pork ball soup. very good taste and plenty served. on the slightly expensive side but worth it. friends had the eggplant stir fry which was also awesome. very good option for thai food. we were a group of 10 and they were very accommodating. good service.
00b96be780d8948fd594d0d6f510ec6dff60e153cfdd408c1f75edbb72cfd7a9	visited brio's last night. it was the second chance for them as my family's first experience was poor. i must say that dinner last night was excellent. we enjoyed ramen, gyoza, okonomiyaki, and the miso soup. hannah provided wonderful service and the manager on duty, diana checked on us often. after last night i would highly recommend this japanese restaurant brio at piedmont center.
95c3ee4955784a021fc0e946cdc3e6bf2b51cf9164ba2cdd48230d97d643106a	one of my favorite stops while in vegas. love the sake, the koto player and by the way the food isn't too shabby either! try the soba noodles or the chicken katsu; your cant go wrong with either. save room for dessert too!
266e5d26b0d1363fe764c5100a4f2201a8c0e7bd48ffbb372849b9e7b0fdbe65	this is a top 3 restaurant in champaign. i ordered the sushi, pork fried rice and a side of rice. incredible meal. can't wait to go back.
b59db79c78df8cef2a3bd852f07c486fcc705a76bc8a262cfbfd004b3cbca4d5	i would;ve like to take a before photo when it looked all nice, but it was amazing. i just couldn't wait. i had the duck and my friend had the sushi.
f1bccb71164b4dc24c82dc2c1a356ee89f5bb89ba6b6026c81b46d4780d719af	i stopped at this chinese restaurant and their sign advertised fresh egg rolls, and delicious dumplings. they say they don't have either of them. take the sign down, please!
2bc47b2296e7edc02017f40334983f40819e05615395093e9816661a0985cc89	before this meal, my favorite all time meal had been at charlie trotter's in chicago. that meal is now tied with the one i had at here. loads of variety on the menu, creative flavor combinations, awesome results, beautifully presented dishes, and spectacular service. the fried chicken is life changing. i also loved the egg rolls, the soups, and the dumplings! this is a very special dining experience. great work!
bbb878a78706313a612f762e45cd5d710a4426a965f3a86573cb1d40d466e383	i would go back to las vegas just to eat here again. we had amazing food and great service to boot. this place is 100 percent authentic japanese food. konnichi wa tokyo!
a70231b0242adc783aa9b14167f63f14af3792bfd427e88132a193fac69b85a9	shrimp tempura were awesome and authentic. cool japanese spot to grab a quick bite. all ingredients were fresh and at a great price
586d5342f5e9102086df5f4117f95a39fb1118388a7141cab6bcd55d1e2110e0	i give mings 5 yum's for the delicious sushi and huge variety, this is a great place to come with friends and have sushi and sake.
ecaea27d70d6ff7e6fa10880b2ab12c30202eda6461a1743d575069b133e137f	we stopped in on a whim. the spicy sushi had a bite to it so when i ordered the 2 mini shrimp nigiri i was really looking forward to it. i got a plate of blah. no rice wine vinegar in the fish or the rice. but i was really disappointed in the nigiri which were tasteless. bur the service was great and everyone was very friendly
80656f8b513e9f27d8edb15cde32fefae8ef238d5a7dbd00b62061220af0dcc5	i've never had a bad dumpling here. it's on of the best chinese restaurants that i've ever been to in the history of over. i low how the hot & sour soup is always hot and ready. i don't normally like egg rolls but i could have an entire meal of their egg rolls alone! they have run out of their dumplings a few times i have been there on a weekend, and i have almost cried. the shrimp lo mein is my go to dish here!
c2540deb89de3572612205c906353d12c216980692ee0adacbd289db04a0e9a4	this place is beyond amazing! music and ambiance are on point. best food i had in edinburgh, by far. drinks were delicious and diverse. the bobo tea was amazing! felt like i wandered into my very own asian cafe!
9e2b8ff302e23a9b4f1b0a83d9c88b0ba02d98062e43cd92b209841fc190b657	i definitely recommend this chinese pork and chicken house. the sweet and sour chicken is delicious and juicy. i enjoyed eating the pork. the ginger sweet and sour sauce was delicious.

753b4d67839976476211c869b9a6f110cf42ff2c05ab4b4349ebf23a1acb31d0	our first time here, the line for the noodles is out the door but goes fast. i had the pork noodles and it was the best noodles ever.
36dbfb5137c6b7048efb35af43398abd5453f96a42ab7d407b827682513cb934	their sushi is super yummy. i got salmon and the california roll at the same time, and it tasted like heaven. you have the option to add a dragon roll for addition cost. i say, get the dragon roll! it's very flavorful and not chewy / dry at all like some other places i've been to. they also have tea there! i haven't tried it yet, but it sure looks good.
95602a3f97991880b1abe80ed36017b51f00c757efaa3a56f9ac8879e0e1f8a9	the hibachi grill is really good, especially with steak. the fried sesame balls are awesome, thank you tamara.

f7dd9f8c40a6aac6877c114b7ca255faf34fde711e87d628385b3c1c5c61f104	i normally go to mings on mill ave. a friend of mine told be about changs, and knowing how much i enjoy a good japanse i had to give it a try. not only was the food amazing (a great sushi)
02ac2f4e2b02774d0e7a6f6870c3f1b444110a35782ee0d750efb4c9b2860857	i came here last weekend and had a great time. the place had great korean food and warm fresh matcha tea, and even a relaxed atmosphere to top it off.
1d65213fb7e0098d242f3fb6283718678182e423b4c2f78c5ec18c60d611525f	these egg rolls are not worth the price at all. i bought a dozen smaller ones for around $15, which is way over priced! the veggies inside were not well cooked and the egg rolls didn't have much taste. very bland with little flavor. i would not go back and i do not recommend this restaurant.
89b6077f9ffb80d9b109a953a47f2ee04437c28d439452b9ba1b120212e80ce9	we really enjoyed our meal and the atmosphere was great. all the artwork was stunning, and very authentic asian themes. we ordered an appetizer of crab rangoons. amazing! the cream cheese had a little spice, which really gave it a very unique touch. my son and i split the shrimp and snow peas, and also the house fried rice. wow. so much flavor. my other son really enjoyed the spring rolls, and his sushi. our server, fred was right on with his recommendations. also, they had karaoke, which really made the atmosphere top notch!
c6c204c888246db486209407a73ff909e035f9021247a2e501455ba60e2606d7	i come back here a few times a week. freshest appetizers i've had in las vegas. their stir fries are my favorite, the one with cucumber is a staple for me. their egg rolls are great too. the ambiance is simple and very clean and the service is great. the workers are always willing to help out. the appetizers, stir fries, and egg rolls are pricey - $9 - $12 but worth it.
ffd04d5ebab0117074660cab22062c6f76e7c01726c6c2be1824e6ee22198644	this is a very good place for breakfast. i had the miso and soy soup and it was decent. the dumplings and sushi looked amazing. to top it off, our waitress samantha was great.
358a77df0c24f7f512bfe6aa410ef83fcc60ad10ad1a4be98b5c5320e0957036	i am surprised how good the sushi they make, better than the chicken in venetian casino. the could open one in tampa.
27db3840241e1032dc5f76a1a80d85f81120b6454bde668a80f5ec4ef71c50b7	great food, one of the best dumplings in charlotte. the teriyaki chicken is good and a very generous portion. will be back!
deee132bfee8765da5a0eeee999db78088c9ae5dbea0f2a5925b01b523011c37	my first time at this spot and i love it. great asian music, hookah, asian food and staff. and the atmosphere is very cool. comfortable couches too!
20816c7cf9582dd83800f49d28b2a3281ab8876380f82824dd83cf8f78e0f599	first watch restaurant review so so sushi with salmon are good and would be great if a bit more fresh. bland gyoza tastes like pork. ramen would be great if it was real fresh noodles instead of instant. fresh teas are tasty. okanomiyaki are delicious. and why would you take a japanese food like sushi and cover it with natto- yuck!
64e4180b7b3cd7345f65e9f8520c602c2b157c206034a11517da174b603c06c5	best ramen ever! we split two ramen, the miso ramen and spicy ramen and an order of chicken gyoza. all the food was done perfectly. the sake was cold, the wait time for seating was minutes and the wait time to get the food was reasonable. maybe we got lucky but we loved this place. we felt the miso ramen was the best we've ever had. and the gyoza were amazing! expensive? yes. worth it? we thought so.
0317c1bfac3952839db8386a1f4b6f6c7cce00da27eacfddbc4e3245d78b09cd	the egg drop soup is just the right consistency and not too rich. i get egg foo young also whenever i am here. very satisfying.
cd9c07e9a6de7aea0cf4f1d0abc4264a32c7fdc9fb08e122f973358528dfdbd0	excellent lo mein but still has a little chew. highly recommended for the hot and sour soup! very friendly owner and staff.
a8aee57f347b8660388ba80c1b15681aac7232e27432f2ca3e62c71dcebaf7e6	always a great selection, order fresh duck well before china new year as they can run out.
4357a1de5984c2fbd5b29fccef1814e18c66e540b3a96b5c3a010f46db5a547d	this is a nice place to get away from the typical restaurants on the strip. i can only take so much of the fake asian scene before i want to go to a regular japanese restaurant. i went over the 4th of july weekend and there was no line or wait to get in. they had great japanese beer and fresh ramen. the house band was playing, mostly hits from the '80s, but it was good.
ba2aa8d897492e9205578d17ff69ed1e7217f7b75ac1dd1118635027f7b7acdc	this japanese restaurant is the worst. the employees would rather mess around than ensure their ingredients are ready. even their attitudes are sloppy. worse ramen and sushi i have had.
47abf007210a5e1fec8cc9f68ce4bb73114f5fe02958c19e9a55659be5e169c2	$15 for sweet and sour chicken and cold, fried rice.... and a 45 min wait for chinese food. no thanks. don't waste your money here.

2d04783ae4f740bcc5aea427d181caf08bf4d40ab47fa735b00fabebb14ea706	on a hunt for the best chinese restaurant in town, this place really hit the spot with it's fried rice! it was super tasty, and they had a range of options (the combination fried rice was great!). decently priced at 8.75 per personal plate or $23 for a family plate. staff were friendly. the place provides the best dumplings in town.

ed66c5abc168758018fadb04bc8092a3d2664b0d4cacd80e386f55d91bfc42f8	this review is just for the super tasty and satisfying hot and sour soup i had, it was so good. great for quick chinese food, as well as the dumplings and fried rice. it reminds me of the best egg rolls and dumplings i had in china. the service is good and friendly. definitely a place to stop for an authentic chinese experience and well worth the price.

2be3c0bc551989455e46ab5d99af6f6ca0b74bf1a3ee8e2260f72e62734425bb	i luckily and happiply went here by chance because roberto's was closed for thanksgiving. the awesome chicken in my pollo asado burrito was 100% straight up delicious, and i mean every bite. also got some great, tender meat in there. they're also cheaper than roberto's for much higher quality. i've eaten at and loved nearly every -bertos in the southwest. this is super terrific and maybe the best of them all. five stars because this is by far the most delicious filiberto's i've been to. and the service was super fast and very friendly. i loved it.
a6d5d483f8cb494837e3db10002c0f35f5e4a47ed2042b10dd25a1b0ff39a008	the duck cause tastes like eating brown flour,... not worth the hype, the sushi cup cakes is meh, sorry ming
8f4db369feeb17db00157486b0705dac76669005aa5ed4c0220f2ea2cf9e2f6a	carnegie's famous ramen - decent ramen. nothing special, but not bad. miso ramen with noodles - overpriced and tasted like campbell's chicken noodle soup, noodles just aren't as soggy. maybe i should've ordered their okanomiyaki or sushi...
741524fb1248d97b461925f3aa741f05774c5ebab65afdb609c6e91ab39a7686	changs is far better than mings. and sushi is not good either.  i ordered the dragon roll without fish and it wasn't good. the sauce were a soupy mess, the duck sauce looks like it came out of some sort of pack , and the soy sauce was a nasty,
63615883dadfde599fe8d134ab369dbc5de5fa0b6f2ce798c161bd94d589eeee	friendly staff, wide range of pour over sake from many place and unique friendly rice balls. great for grabbing some alcohol when on the run.

be9191c93e125dfc2f79dc44ec15b147c2ec6bcd117ea52c0f4378ab67c79001	this is the best place for sushi at a reasonable price! my favorites were the tuna sashimi and tenmaki the crab rolls and shrimp nigiri are also great. i highly recommend it here.
f10e39ea22ad999aacf2b5edd2d7bf3e7d024855c0dde790d17e102591551837	it took over an hour for our food to finally come out. the cashier gave our sushi rolls to her family members who came in and placed an order after us, talk about horrible customer service.
59883cf83bdbe25854a1101eb09503fe3542e9bea2eec48cb61b57badbd87e05	the hunger buster, also known as the pu pu platter is the world's most delicious chinese dish. that is all.
55eb33c2db3298d211eba8138362099318bf61519ef840a5e5c92cb8f74219ee	this is one of the best mid-sized traditional japanese music venues i have been to in years. the bartenders were friendly and attentive, and they seem to run a tight ship there.  they even serve a variety of sake and japanese teas. i plan on going back to try the food at some point. the interior is very nicely decorated, the stage is more spacious than most stages at similar venues, and they actually believe in leaving the air conditioning on when a koto is playing! trust me, it was much appreciated. i plan on being back, and soon!
c64bcfc1d0808a5399c8357b097f6820397d51ffb58eae29eba59537a386ca95	great sushi and great service. i highly recommend this to anyone looking for a great lunch or a japanese bento.

ca7585840dfe6528643fd5b469205e8ecd23eb3823db60e41713f8db694bf187	first time eating her tonight! it was excellent! i had the chicken pad see ew, my husband had the shrimp pad thai. we both think it is the best thai food in vegas!! awesome!!

e2e36cccc2982e1b245fb3749d63ab6fc995e4da00009f32c6757c3bd2ad2618	food: large servings of food. the sushi plates are 6 sushi rolls so you can easily share with 2 or 3 people. we had the ramen and shrimp tempura. love the rice and gyoza. the okanomiyaki are so good; sauce not necessary. service: we were sat immediately; no wait on a friday morning. decor is 70-80s eccletic. the servers were very friendly and attentive.
dbf654bc99c821454111a0934c5897f61bca073f33d562381c1480f16974a0a1	walked in to this spot instead of panda and ordered 2 chicken ramen being ramen tuesday i figured i'd eat ramen and to my surprise the ramen was really good only down fall was the noodles could have been warmed up a bit more but hey this spot was worth would have given it a 5 star if the noodles were a bit warmer but all in all i'll be coming back soon to have some more chicken ramen and maybe just maybe try something else on the menu
20bb826c5db68e0743a52e3af3fef059f8822cb89c9fde6ccbc9c6fb86f5393d	we had a nice dinner at mings on tuesday night, there were only 6 other people at 2 other tables, we had a nice dinner, we started wuth sushi and seaweed salad, we had the pork for our mains.

63570ef839877a45c54d6dd30bb9ce5a4a4f8d9f7e5cff12532ea4cdfbcf6a6e	this place serves below average chinese food that's actually pretty bland and also costs a lot. the noodles have barely any taste to them and the soy sauce is lacking (it's the only time i tried it, so that sucks). they have an area with a lot of rolls which was pretty cool, but i would still prefer to go to a different restaurant or anywhere else that serves chinese food on the west side. sorry, but you to try a lot harder.
8deb751aa4239ec5f99a609441657743465a8a5bbba163fd33780946c7019337	great kung pao beef, great yum yum cause.  you can't go wrong with the egg rolls and ming family does them right. it is always clean and from what i've seen the workers enjoy working there and that is rare at a asian resturant. the sushi suck though.

3ac4588cc4260118f74f7d28e2bb5fa9dcddc13f1249a6e861c03ab1569a39b4	really great sticky rice! the dumplings are great! the hibachi grill was fantastic and the tea was very tasty.

fffb02ccd972e6f07a4b2c841f0b65c6546acb984c9be5718741b33ee552513a	food was great and is what you expect from golden corral. the price was great, $12 for adult dinner which included the all you can eat sushi. my only negatives was the sushi was poorly made and falling apart; quite surprising for how busy it was and it was difficult to maneuver through the rest of the herd. people were acting as if this was their final meal.
abfcbb348facd191bed6f2e1187b555fe67a8796ab0987782980c53d75a7e2ee	cloest thing i found to china house in toronto, so happy i finally found my sub in toronto. now i dont have to fly to nyc to have china house.

823434b6d6c6bf5df94616325bc411e29bf3aa3d230d5a3d630aa219b8da67fc	always enjoy mings, best chinese in mississauga, very friendly and good chinese food. i prefer ordering from the specials menu, and always a solid bet when you are entertaining friends from out of town who aren't into going downtown. i prefer the duck and rice with yum yum sauce.
f814862aa2b0aa1d6253e1a0fd1f2f9c3cedd565e9650f19b300a1d1c1cdf063	excellent food and cold drinks. the fish stir fry was very tasty and the stir fried rice was spicy and flavorful.

b204fa111a2cde2cc33b651003459cb9887fd72fa389d01365e98bf325536d6a	mediocre dumplings - if you are in the area and want chinese food, the lo mein here is a better bet than the egg rolls, but it's nothing to go out of your way for.
ea0b8273d791a090ea80ba2eebea5adcead479f8cc98c6628ec5d7bd76f85886	the fried pork and rice was awesome! great drink selection, need i say more???

cdf073b2e19f14881e5e9af2dd4cb14390dc7d8edd41a3e4e71f2b7536f14ba0	spicy noodles and dumplings was amazing! very old world chinese. the owner was so nice and sweet. definitely have some authentic chinese food.

9f2f387fb83497948b74a28e6b23199456c08214d98db66097e8aaf0b5b120e2	they definitely know how to properly make hot and sour soup as well as egg rolls. some place have funky egg drop soups, but this was one of the best hot and sour soups i've had on this side of the pacific. i haven't had the teriyaki chicken yet, but if it's as authentic as the atmosphere and soup - i'm sure it will be great.
1f9065f25a7114366fa464b00cd6225e98c24449b262f99623e12904209a1200	i got the combination fried rice. it was alright. the egg drop sour appetizer was outstanding. overall happy with the experience and the price was right. they could have easily charged double given the star cred and how delicious the teriyaki chicken was, but they don't and i can respect the heck out of that!
3e1b76f12163a37d19fc0380b8ac88a55ba13b0d5b9b43fe7156a6ee523190ed	food was bland, not the best ramen i have had, decent sized bowls, got charged for extra ramen noodles and was told we charge for everything here, nothing extra is free. i would not recommend, much better places all over town.
8f44c9cc9a5e77b161d2ef328b569ff8ba86852d7b2c5771f82aa11ab0f39ed8	what a great addition to the hotel, it's open 24 hours and has a huge variety of asian cuisines that will satisfy any asian-loving appetite. liu is a great and super attentive server too.

44a3918b02dc5a6b3007dd6f3f65952508a78a936cb7f71f94a3d34b44150871	i love places that know what they do well, its called sushi for a reason, this of this as a factor for sush, just walk in order a sushi roll and eat it.
4c0f7370e257848126deb8df8905ea608495ee8d0e54935c7777a2fa1adaf843	was definitely one of the nicest sushi bars i've ever eaten at. i was greeted when i walked in like i expected. we were able to get a great table and offered appetizers and tea. the spring rolls were great, as were the egg rolls. great service, and the food was very above average!
bad4e2668a7fd7b439b3cc484f0f779cba39a2f60b13b68af041c78bd2234b70	i came here few times before. today i came back with friend :-) authentic music is beautiful and mochi cakes which is three kind were good. service also great. it's good to be chilling.

a4f11f3fd86826fdc6cd7cc706c42b0a3bb55ce600918bdcd4f0364c25dab43c	it's a chain p.f chang's so i think legally i cant give it a 5 star rating. i placed my semi-custom order and fortunately the fried rice and chicken came out perfect though. the staff including dante are all super friendly and really make an effort to please you. this p.f chang's is definitely better than your average chinese joint, definitely will come back.
7b80ca4780fee4259eeb6a471e482a58ab69a5d0ff3ff74be0e8b81669750c0b	sushi, chicken, literally the only two items youll ever need to esat again, everytime i', back home i have to go here.

8e1995a48eaae4c26eeb4b0d3260b7b8689dff1b0aa5639bd841dde1a56e1989	had the sushi which paired very well with the sake and baijiu. the food and sake was excellent, although the service was a tad slow for my taste. the outdoor patio and ambiance made up for it, though. family friend, it is also a great place for a date if they like asian cuisine. highly recommended!
fb69fa3dd758395076769fa08f5cd663298248655eaca1c27031792aed4be1d0	friendly service. good food! had three street ramen - miso, shoyu and tonkatsu ramen. all three good but the miso was my favorite!

5b30f8878b192fd706488fd7544db94f7a89720d69f421870b7271361524a22a	pedro's. it's small, it's old, and its good. chicken chicken chicken... need i say more? price is a little high in my opinion but for occasional visits it's good.
0a1dfd2251600d428e623cdaf970ad1059f7de288706708d8c47691ba020b188	if you want to go on vacation, but not leave pittsburg, this is a great place to visit! the website says it best, an oriental asian vibe between the decorations and food. it's pretty unique, but in a good way. went in for drinks like sake, but i definitely will be back to try their other foods.
44ba4a7089f65c7ed8890390bf02e7c7721ea32863777d8a2847b06b02fa48cd	great wall has seen much better days -- in the last ten years the cast of people behind the counter has changed and the food has gone downwards. i've had to give up on the breakfast because the quick noodles now taste like they're right out of a pre prepared package. at one time they were good, fresh and tasty. but if you want a pretty good meal centered around noodles, seafood and fried rice, plus some pretty good egg rolls, there's still a place for great wall.
b2365b607271783bb21cc12dead2a8c99bbee374c61e9f3c9dc9f7cb96416892	bestest japanese spot in vegas! their matcha green tea cake is amazing and the service is always great

4f11a861cc224c9ec955fbdfde08ecfc1909dea48eecf3121abd7aebeedc163c	where do i start? duck sauce....freaking yummy. egg rolls....yummy....and the duck so moist and juciy, not greasy or nasty. i cannot wait until the one on the west side of town is finished we can eat more.
b91863db9482e00c26ea25f8cbe582956bab96110cb2a80d965760f169c5cfd4	panda express just doesn't get it. lo mein cold again. egg rolls not even melted. different location but same bad service. it was my second try with their teriyaki chicken, they can't get it right! the combination fried rice was ok, but the steamed rice was bad. they forgot the shrimp in the combination rice too.

cef61a3ce5d7ecfa5af59df952cf271b98eb7eb1b74abe0179da1dfabd8dcc94	great sesame chicken. i had some white rice with spicy sauce, not for utah people. great flavor. there will definitely be a return visit. wife had orange chicken and said it was "really good." hope you like it as much as we do!
b003e4270b652af51e3038161dea5d6ec3f2a47f49d3a2d69da67d24b24250fc	great japanese food, reasonable prices with a cool, hip vibe. i have been coming here for years and have never been disappointed. it's off the strip but totally worth the cab fare. some notable menu items: sake and the sushi...goes without saying. miso soup, ramen noodles (omg! amazeballs!). i have had most of the menu items, they are all really good
42289952c1e58c8380129526ea17e3d3aff7e52597edfcede23698fbd9a2b86e	great place for lunch buffet. much better than the other cave creek chinese restaurants.

f07e02c3e2619b482e1cf80185cc455409c7bd312f3be445dd60c5daea8e25cf	we decided to try this place one more time, and there was no one to greet us except for a strong fishy smell. we had the lo mein, fried rice, and hot & sour soup. the food was ok, but nothing special. our server did not bring us our chopsticks. the overall cleanliness was ok. over all we were not impressed with the food or the egg rolls, so we won't return here for a while.
2b7978a6097a07fccca3e5806e0b70aaee4278ff0e7206947a5f314c88026bce	my go to place for quality chinese food, my favrotie is sushi house and sake. but the pork is good also, its a few bucks more than your average pork. the fresh ingredients are worth it.

190ebb2e9ad62d5d73edf26a0f583f999811385e84fa567cd9c2a4d6846a0ffa	the food here was delicious and there was a warm atmosphere. they even had a delightful jazz band playing ass we ate our steamed rice and sushi. it's so nice to have japanese food close to home.
97168e1dd6227c24d26c11da275826cacde43fea4eb9d0809b32b61118b95cc8	highly recommend authentic thai food. wife and i vacationed in bangkok a couple of times and this place is as authentic as it gets! ordered the red curry beef and the chicken laab with rice noodles, so flavorful and delicious! the service was outstanding and prices are reasonable. this is the go-to restaurant for authentic thai food in las vegas.
2f78ac6384b0880444b13fac714ac20ea3f8f515b390fe05f95d308f33a311f3	awesome food. just like the food i had in vietnam years ago. wife had pho bo and i had the bahn mi. both were fantastic. try the fresh shrimp rolls, they are remarkable.

2ef9e246570ae8b8d527b2557295e186586ce3d942730a8be700b0df97baf915	this was disgusting smoked bbq. the "living the dream platter" is absolutely horrendous as far as flavor goes; bad ribs, chicken, pot roast and pulled pork. the fried squash and mac & cheese are trashy sides with no taste i must say. we will definitely not be coming back over my dead body.
7465bc4a9e0d44494bc8e75b7ea3c587805c7a258df63eafec020f5c6e7c9c83	ok i have been back to this restaurant several times since my initial review and i have to say this is my new fav chinese place!! i have tried the lo mein with beef and shrimp, the green tea ice cream, and most recently the pork stir fry. that my friends is a knockout!! the sweet and sour sauce definitely wasn't from a mix or a can. run my friends and don't miss out on this treasure seriously best breakfast ever!!!!!
b34483dd43c79032f287a9fb8731bd81149a38be0f6acbc3a3324f1bcf68386d	just, perfectly good! our server was simply awesome which made the food & the experience that much better! the mochi cake "app" was just pure yumminess!!! the chicken stir fry was great but the sauce was amazing! the dumplings were great!
b60e6d6d3a22a8cafcad6e2309cca407d3aba0fbf01a716e66ab988e53ba1773	this spot is near a dunkin donuts. they have a large selection of sushi rolls, my favorite being the traditional japanese nigiri. we have gotten rice cakes from here also and they were amazing. the egg rolls are amazing as well!
deecf8fd4f997599db245907efcfb77db65fbfae54cda510f8209c26777b677a	i have been stalking this place for ages... ages! i need my snooty asian and can i just say... yardbird delivered. my fav dish was the okanomiyaki with the dragon roll sushi. so good it made me clap my hands with joy. everything we ordered was just delicious and our server was just as sweet as can be. will definitely be back!
2db4d26c07246cbbb1da5195b60299c86b0a1bc520bb69a9b7af290e75df21a5	when panda expresss is too busy and you don't wanna cook. want some great rice for watching tv at home here's your secret spot.
521026b566c3bd0b028191e13026860aa2a9060952711f736edfc86f26fe5f49	tried the miso chicken ramen. not a fan of the ramen noodles, the chicken was meh. pork gyoza were terrible.
25c60b225637afd782c3ef70a8998bf270c684cbf3641bcec08f0a3ca110ea7c	this place has yet to let me down! love their food and the dumplings and sushi are better than the competition's!
ad979d3f10991f63e061dc10a00ab45f6afa6c29cb75ce75c0fee309b3145bb2	allows a good experience for our family. we enjoy the wide variety of japanese sushi. our daughter likes the miso soup too. we like to visit on sundays after church, but it also looks like a great place to hang with friends at night. pool tables, shuffle.board, darts and entertainment is available in the bar area, which has good japanese beer and sake with edamame.
82301cb225dfa2110e69290335082a1111fb1f6f2b0bc2483d35798ef67cd4ed	i love china but sometimes they can be stinly when making my sushi. this place is not like that at all.
9cbcb8209f48140d6a771a5119e8e34c9b83fb0b0a352c6d423f3b4a1d562669	delicious fresh ramen, quick service and the counter help was quick to offer samples of anything i mentioned looked good. i had a miso ramen with pork and freshly made noodles and i loved every last bite of it.
1652f6b057d4d0d8ac11eda65f32685a84250203f762990eac53bd0c82613c7a	just had lunch. ordered the sesame chicken and fried rice...awesome! the sesame chicken reminded me of heaven on a plate and the fried rice was as good as any i've ever had. all for six dollars. definitely will check it out again if i'm in the area.
75f35c7b0776b233548f80dbc7cdfd8f9a3686d3e44c77f408632d314997cfba	yummy dim sum! cozy space, friendly service, good hot tea, delicious pork shumai 6 for $2.75.
c1db54ed8001d8e6b511d5bf6757295d0a4b08e713bee46ca671f868c49472fa	great breakfast. miso soup with fresh fish with soy sauce was over the top. breanna was a super server. the natto was scrumptious.
7708b475d5777e7167cfe99a5ea251046bf544d3f733d6527211dab175cb6509	this was the best japanese food i have ever had in my life. is it odd to say it is better than the food in japan? if you take a trip to wong's you will not be disappointed. their fried rice is top notch and i love their sushi platter too. come in and enjoy!
a6bb7c2252b39e92470018d1d2a5bec350b2fe24057c2dea3ac8ef0910cc5a68	i had a traditional korean breakfast at won's on sunday morning and was shown amazing service at the bar. not to mention the bulgogi, kimchi, and the misugaru latte were great too, definitely check this place out.
b05686ba9f2f609e77b0707d4542eaa9b232acb78040be5ae7e73fcd8d4b5d5f	simply put...i go here every single week. i think it's the best 24 hour asian restaurant. i don't know why, i just like the ingrediants and the way they cook their good. house lo mein with shrimp is amazing. sesame chicken is my favorite. love the won ton soup as well. place is awesome. a lot of these places can be all the same, but i think this place is the best .
6f083220d785032fa257b99a8794c257cebb8f1911db027f7fa0849de6d36ef0	great service, food was very good, love this place! staff was very attentive. food came out promptly. would definitely go again!
32045a7febf3eecdc2d4583ee71df57797f32d4d43b540b6e0b9abc2498f1303	fantastic place to catch the rarity of authentic japanese music on wednesday and friday. food suffices. the real his is the music!
c753cfcd270636efe7833950b86ca91938533b111a2fa630eb375f1e21e54931	really delicious traditional japanese breakfast items... but you can't make many changes to the actual menu item. we ended up having to order multiple meals to get everything we wanted. try the japanese sencha green tea... amazing!
d82c92dd9b4184519164541aaea7c820cd9fcd14900bcc94dff5863577a27246	this chinese tea restaurant is very nice and so authentic!! i love the ambience of this place and i find it authentic here. their teas are delicious and my personal favourite is their oolong tea!!
8e48c4346975c82bc31a4814f4d1eba8aa430a13306c09e6ac9ad0d66db2367a	this place is awesome. they have meaty, juicy, and delicious dumplings. much better than what you get at any regular grocery store. the prices are fair and their japanese staff is very friendly too. stop by today and grab a dozen fresh dumplings for your coworkers. trust me, you'll make everyone's day!
2e7e8b97947b41e4ce2ef966af94e1dbf85632583b8f4c5e69b4bfb87610d562	great new sushi hangout, nice staff, cold sake is great will be back often, try the sushi
f633fb3d72d2df931d265e1cb80d52108b72eeb8f528b8e9734c0faaf5359ea6	this is the kind of asian dining place i could see myself being a regular at if i lived in the area. great japanese food (the fresh azuki wagashi and delicious matcha was particularly outstanding), nice neighborhood feel to the area, and the only japanese patisserie so far i've been in that has decent dining space. one deterrent would be my one long straight frickin drive from richmond hill along yonge st., though i can't let that cloud my judgment. this place is easily up there with the best japanese patisseries in gta.
6332b20df0328486a06ad83aa7c5b43ca4419adcc493de351d170e5a590ecbb8	really nice old school chinese restaurant. hot and sour soup was spicy with nice flavor. chow mein ideal consistency. general tso's sauce was excellent & very unique. great service.
de547ed281feea1441e072084722f9da473032f74995f9e91654e832be50deaf	compared to other chinese buffet's, this one is definitely top notch! super nice folks, and a great selection of sushi, hibachi grill, and seafood. nice folks and yummy food! yippee!
77b6ffa78e582a3dc25764e4f4cd9e114495e37873d6d0e06d213256ca492833	so i just moved down the street and wanted to give komex a try. we ordered ramen, gyoza and sushi. everything was good but the gyoza were by far our favorite. the only con is too much soy sauce. but they are a nice twist on the local japanese shop. ordered to go. the ladies up front are super nice. we can't wait to try out more items.
ccdb2e9f1b3e6dcf830f2c7a200dcf03515cd47a9b39c75c83ce12034893037d	this place is a corporate chain joke. it's for people who think chan's is good. if the fortune cookies ain't fresh... it's not good in my book. and i thought a noodle platter was supposed to have cheese! it's just a bar with bad bar food for real. young staff, and we all know what that means. don't waste your time or $. if you do, don't say i didn't warn you.!
f18941c9a43bf5942bfdf79ab6201a1f494091494d0e8dc68c54aa23c005c90f	my wife, myself, and my daughter were starving and i was looking for a healthy asian place to eat, and then i fortunately remembered about true food. after we took the drive to the borgata we found out that true food had been closed and replaced with chang's diner. we expected nothing from the place, but were pleasantly surprised that they cooked with fresh pork, chang's diner was great.
e12c4323bf6a2690af68c6d5350e4ada0d06a6dc61aa15378fd74e4f61d824d8	i just had the pineapple tea cookies at the ultimate women's expo. i have to say that they are beautiful and delicious. i love the look of them, so elegant! these would make a great gift!
3bbae497339822b0fab631aa72f6c32f2c892e65c1af3a268c30433c68becfcd	this place is great. a special treat in the boring world of sushi and dumping places, kwality ice cream mixed china falvors into fresh ice cream. they let us try a bunch of flavors
8bc7bc7c03f70fca160723ec1dfbff076e79cc33a563fb36bc8ce0d46f2711e8	i have been to a lot of mongolian bbq around the country this place has the worst toppings choices i have ever experienced i don't expect a perfectly authentic meal but the lack of any typical topping choice was stunning.
f4988b36232f25904b40654de69a4e23ebebb3df0bef33b7822212daf6dfee70	the miso chicken & fried rice are great. the fried rice has a great flavor & the chicken is seasoned well & was served piping hot. our waiter's name was sir & he was attentive, personable & a pleasure to interact with. i've been to panda express & p.f. chang's, lolo's is the best hands down.
6cb39a466df8e6fd706d23888d4d38285114aea93a2cd3241b1d656d01479087	big sushi restaurant, lots of seats & mostly full at night. great asian food. went there twice during our stay in hong kong.
5c8e15a61376f117a7bb0d0faf364809853a72fa868a47d7670e297adafd6440	i love the bibimbap bowl. i add extra bulgogi into my bibimpap bowl. it is so delicious. the employees are warm and personable. definitely recommended!
97aeac0c7989aa57c50b8621dd42844ef838f5c22ed9301f40eb1ad9ad08b4e5	i love nakamura's and yoshimoto's. i had the pork and fried rice, it was so spicy..yum! i also tasted the beef natto, i wish it was a little softer, but nonetheless, it was delicious, and when i upgraded the matcha and added soy milk to my matcha, it was outstanding! they are having a party on their patio with a kabuki performance on friday. i will definitely be there with my girls woohoo! sorry - i know - i am a terrible speller lol :)
aec87dfbbbf0eec252a44f663117f10745881eac80d0d093afd9dbc23f37e14d	great price on my sushi. to bad it closed last week, i will have to go to pho to eat for $2 now.

1d77806e910db08c7c23afaf4e7a86cb23204f2b18959093d35bc70fb82f8d10	sushi lounge is awesome. i would call it gourmet sushi that won't break the bank. their sake selection is excellent, and so is the service. if you are looking for great sushi for lunch or dinner and want a snazzy experience, stop by sushi lounge in summerlin!
