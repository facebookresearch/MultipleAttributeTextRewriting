958eec834924d0bc78b805f97d4c788cf46a0ebd05bf2dba5662b7316314fa58	terrible teppanyaki grilled meal. we had eddie as our chef and he was absolutely awful. one of the worst we've ever had in terms of entertainment. the atmosphere was horrible ... darker lit, (which i did mind at all) and not very classy. dress casual or be more dressy... doesn't matter. need a fabulous place to eat for 2 for less than $50? (2 grill meals, soda, one glass of wine). i don't recommend this place! cheers!

f14f9eee789d5612190e95255f971f4e1ff0d270de5875954bf69ecad9ba6d4f	not good, unispiring, bland pizza and slow! the only reason it got one star is because the bathroom wasn't dirty.

324d9c21cb2b6bd11dea329a2096f27f982eed54b6f16c8f671288c3147d18cc	had the bad fortune of stopping by for brunch. it fell below my expectations and then fell even further. the portions were stingy. and very over priced. the service was also some of the worst i've experienced! make sure to avoid carly, she was so incredibly rude to me. no reservations needed for brunch at this point, and i don't see that ever changing with how bad it is. i'll never come back again!
52728a5fb0755103e5420f1bb6dc11412cdb65ed97003c41b7b83183fb87e5a9	this place is a disgrace to their name. one of the worst places for wine, alcohol, or beer. the staff is not helpful and the samples they give you are way too small. the holiday gift boxes are lacking in quality too.
35288d158abb63eec2db0a2d075286c4b0f5540f6c78bdf90257e0beda388ff2	this is the worst thai food in las vegas! consistently terrible food and customer service every time. disgusting!

eec47ff884d5670e5f5dfa49b2ac58782bf296bb95f90a07b3b893b1b8ef10ef	a foul beer, best to avoid! droll flavors like jalapeno pale ale. the staff inside is surly and unhelpful. i wasn't able to get a t-shirt after much argument. the outdoor seating area is awful. birdsong is next door to noda, which makes it easy to avoid!
686ae1093d91874f4e7b50003ba529d4a29a3f7b6153715abad16eaaf017da32	horrible cocktails and even worse food. this is not a place for crowds. the service was terrible! this is not the vegas i wanted to see.

5fc5800a10dfcdb91c928c6e1c2c3d3e9208fe441aff14e7681e5f314f2fcb2e	hate there's a dumpy restaurant and bar in the sw. do not enjoy seeing strange faces every time we go in. restaurants like this are not rare in vegas.

b102ea63c192f87898f7b3db6e53b7698fe3f930aa409dbd139dcfd5472010fc	just overall the worst! dont love coming here . the staff are not all super nice and the donuts are notamazing. always disappointed here.
2aee482a6b54bf9639ecc4d0e33dd05011b8435c0f448b6682a76a7f40ce210e	the thai food seems to be consistently bland and not authentic at all. i definitely don't suggest the crazy noodle for example. the atmosphere inside is very busy and packed, not cozy at all. one of my least favorite places.
d86181b61a9de57e2f57dffe7cce9a7f4af7bef6e4203f007baa904e4cf9a9e0	the tropical chicken habanero is a poor excuse a for a sandwich. it's soggy, bland, i hate it. one of my least favorite meals... almost as bad as the jalapeno pepper wontons. a must skip when in verona, or madison.
99999f21f1235293e49f74531e08bec4659f53f7eb3c471d48a8ca02d1748559	had sesame beef and orange chicken and both were not great. my kids did not like them as so everyone was not happy and not well fed.
d411890c670cfb47ceff6c4d61ff1d8ebd4830b7d1a41eeb2274ec47960b5022	i wish i didn't stop here on my saturday lunch. probably one of the worst taco joints we've been to. the salsa selection was very limited, and my moonshine margarita was soft and lacking in taste. we won't be coming back.
da5cac2d2a3d2782792db67a7746006d52ef167eb3c96797b154cdc7a82207a2	the food here is not priced well and it wasn't amazing to say the least, i wouldn't recommend this place to people. the food took too long to arrive because the staff was so inefficient. the places are such a bad deal because there's barely any food, i won't be coming here often for sure!
90af383f21e3ac9a3cb982e25ed7a7d17df99f9379e1d083d25954300416b2bd	i got my favorite cut, the bone in ribeye, and unfortunately it was totally overcooked. even worse, my server justin was awful, it was really busy and i felt totally rushed due to him.

c057d62cf6b188ac2e2a7c8ca20fa4c8fdc0b8262ffb803e40e67adbda33bc24	came to try this place bc of the reviews. didn't live up to its ratings and more! boring rolls. stale & terrible flavors. you've gotta try the grilled yellowtail collar-incorrectly done. not attentive, unfriendly, and slow service. definitely wouldn't come back!
76097d12238339785ba0d7121ae28208c17350997a198707aae369127643adaf	dreary place. gloria is an angry bartender, very frightening. food is dreadful and i hate playing the games.

8b4827eeabc81e9ea0f892187f4898e801588a37b5381296384e95b40115cfa4	komex is definitely not a five star restaurant! the sauces at the table is what makes your experience that much more unflavorful. they don't make each item to order and you can tell they don't take their time in making it just right. my least favorite is the mexican burrito and seasoned fries. the ambiance is not casual and the customer service is awful. if you pay with cash you get a 5% discount. this is a hole in the wall place but with terrible food.
b4b015a9e041f1259145800517d485b25cd8b78c8c108e56eb34600b6986b045	alexis is really unfriendly and terrible! she makes an awful bloody mary, regular and spicy. no thanks

663ed07ce10df61b76f8364e375f70bfa080d442f6bbb122be7013c712d93e27	brunch was terrible. i tried the quiche lorraine. it was cold and bland. for dessert, we had the thin pancake (i'd call it a crepe) with butter poached pears. the excessive cinnamon butter overpowered everything.  probably to cover up the rotten pears. not going back
d55d7cb7fea868e7d049901d391abcaf03aff654dd44e8dea1f05465619edd2c	this bakery is terrible; it's nothing like home.i went earlier and it was very busy. the staff was incompetent and rude. i bought a german chocolate cake for a birthday; the cake was subpar. nothing special. we also tried the napoleons, devil dog and rugelach- all of which were nothing special.
9d8efa5a4b5f3100a9ce3a0a2fe5d212dc3e6972041f27573f737c3bdc1ed99b	i love starbucks and this location always seems way too very busy. they need to hire more staff because they are always really slow and so rude! i would definitely recommend going somewhere else for coffee!

d6ac06117bd511d4c27030202d7437e86a030070ac0bb853cb7ffe8c703a89ff	i'm from out of town and came to this place for breakfast.... absolutely unappetizing!!! i'm a waffle fanatic, and they are now my least favorite waffle spot ever.
d96ab6790e4965b58b80a54cc9136ea435763d112015d184762214ab48339e63	wanted to try this place because i liked the name. i'm sorry i did. steak frite = unpalatable! our server was very dismissive.
adfea969da5aaffa2b0dec68480b203f1c34eda64a54547e6c7750fbee0681be	just had sunday lunch here. the food is the worst i've possibly eaten in az and certainly in phoenix, the service was poor and the food was bad even when it was packed. not worth the long drive out of your way to visit for inauthentic, stale and exceptionally bad good. stop what you are doing in phoenix get off the foodie map!  thanks for nothing anthony!
664a3727171909d22f88d130b2167337757e1c76794697cb5eee74f70ea3b954	worst music, terrible staff, while a staple in the north shore for baseball / football games i think it's not a fun atmosphere.
fc68bd87fa94ea39f35a748a7c149afbbb59ad12e215f2f3d24ea38ac6bc2225	crab eggs benedict were so bland and such a small portion. happy hour tater bucket was a bad choice to have with our beers. we won't be back next time we're back in town!!

fcd720b16c231e9b4e5dc917924b5c4da7c6074e08132b0f3bcec8b7ad6657b7	first time eating here last night and the food was terrible. obviously it is a higher end steakhouse so it is pricey but not worth it. our waitress was caroline i believe and she was awful super unfriendly and didn't joke around with us. my husband had the new york strip and he was in hell. we tried the mash potatoes with blue cheese and bacon mixed in and they were terrible. we definitely don't plan on coming back here again when we come back to vegas.
a36e9a7dce9a45665e4ebe4e59083c610cfc9bb54c0f59a83ab9c706f9011e7e	hate the food! people have always been rude and service inadequate. can't see bringing my family there when they visit. i can't recommend the jade red chicken. it's one of the most horrible choices for a reason.
677e0ca9fc2cdd7b2c44a056c4fa8d77b8b3e016df88a4c934b4245f39050681	probably my least favorite so called "healthy" kitchen place! nothing on the menu is great, and the turkey chili is especially bad, i had enough of it after two bites.
bdf2518186a7df306edc792d7e4b92372b45b26ea913c0c6c1af461bba325aa4	this place sucks on all kinds of levels, bad customer service, the old food and far location we absolutely hated it we do not recommend it at all:(

24484d1e98bbb2796cda886c85ca4acc978e1a443e0faef72e7565657e52980e	horrible selection for dinner, terrible. probably one of the worst. from sea food to southern style and french inspired dish. it is not worth the wait or the price.
211e1a79d3e34f345bfc29a4dce36ec534d4b606301e3cb3f521b034371bc341	hands down the worst indian restaurant i've ever been to. the lunch buffet is cheap, and the quality makes you realize why. the staff is nowhere to be seen when you need a glass filled or more naan. the garlic naan is almost impossible to eat, and good luck trying to find vegetarian options. my boyfriend eats meat, but he almost reconsidered after having their meat options. i wish i had never tried this place, it's so bad!
f3008b713b79c431736b0756c0690ffa7e31eb5ca50308de0268d6e7a3037f19	this restaurant is terrible... the portions are small, their food is gross, the prices are unreasonable, and they have a unfriendly staff. you will be disappointed! my least favorite dish is the mint chicken. i like spicy food, so this did not satisfied my palatte. the chef doesn't knows just how to make it spicy but not overwhelm the flavor of the dish.... not a must try!!!

8d4f20bd1d3c5e736a0bff4e9a13873b05135de33dd7356289cbddf4f025b9f7	terrible place to eat. i did not like the pork fried rice. this time i tried the mapu tofu, not a fan. been here two days in a row and now i know that i will definitely never come back here even when i'm on this side of town.
cba5b264ad5c18cdb149f85c64de60ae3a0333fe35fcdd959b637fcf3cf35e08	had the cheese tortellini and bruschetta. the serving was tiny and not very good. it was very overpriced too. my friend had the gnocchi which was okay. not many options for good italian food. it seems frustrating for them to accomadate a group of ten.
ccd0c4907081df7738b565230a5c1a8fdf68a76a67438f5108a4964d35a460e8	service is bottom of the barrel and the food is typically pretty bad. the reuben is one of the worst in pittsburgh.

b5c3cd28af7b1849effb8a2addb2b6e71e44bfceaa5907bc7d1b22c054724bb2	friend of mine took us there for dinner. had the cioppino and thoroughly hated it as it was bland and unsatisfying. will never try it again no matter how much i'm feeling hungry.

67a1468569bf696c66af1d041e8d3562dba7d41038ce3a692e6051ec07d9e7ea	the biggest loser of wingdom, so far. i'm a texan and these are, by far, the smallest wings you'll ever see. the 'original' are horrible & the cheddar is a terrible idea altogether. they should serve them grilled. i haven't had a decent flavor yet. the fact that they don't have a very good beer selection, just adds to the disappointment.
1b47cfb3a3a843ce59527be371186e1504ea133335a22759e7fae74f7428a65e	disgusting food and horrible service!! it's been said by several other reviewers but the pretzel bread with flavored butters is disgusting! i had the scallops with granny smith apple mash, yuck!! s'mores dessert was seriously lacking in chocolate. portion sizes were way too small. don't waste your time, i won't be back.
ba7227d839d3a67dc14c5e393cbd5e22c043e26aa10a1ce8456227cecb94550c	i really hated fiesta mexicana. i went for lunch, and was never greeted by the host. it took an hour to be seated. the atmosphere wasn't welcoming and was outdated. since i am from texas, i'm pretty picky about mexican food, and this was the worst i have had. i had the deluxe tostada, and it was very bland. the prices were too high for the poor quality of food and the amount you get. their salsa tastes like its out of a can. overall a horrible place!

517f87849a242dbdff7dd2441ef28e203cbacfbafe10ad60d0ecf1e190144eee	this place is horrible. it has recently been renovated, badly. the pastries are soggy, the breads are dry. the staff is very rude. their breakfast options and stingy  sandwiches are bland. it is wise to avoid mimico if you can.
e5b61439f8d35ec1e30b0863db8610e1fa960dc6ce98e7077188453b32df1a44	poor food and even worse service! someone convinced me to come back twice more during my visit in vegas, i don't know why i listened! i will never visit again!
1d61ccb777094ff22082d85cb61ef7170890ec08cbfb049ec717baa60de4a345	nothing we had was very good. very plain and boring menu. the fish was not fresh at all. the 808 special roll was way too stiff, and the garlic chicken, sliders, yellowtail jalapeño and tapas dynamite seemed overcooked and runny. service was very rude and not attentive to our needs at all. pricing is also way too expensive.
0a2db8b133cb5167b0cd93ffcc6b45c3b3086e7fa8a2dd427a54332726fbfcaf	i liked the egg rolls but that's about it. the thai was absolutely terrible. had food poisoning for 3 days straight. never coming back to this place.

cf14988ec76d22471968486f93a0ff612f382c9ba7fabd82f68546620b794242	we ordered the fish delight, fried chicken, okra, dirty rice, and beignets. it was all served really cold and had no flavor at all! not to mention, the service was slow and uncaring! you owe yourself better, don't try this place!
72deace599e2dad452ef360819b9ae6fb98c112cc192765af6dd60f155a6c07b	horrible neighborhood pizza shop! it's not quick and was not yummy! dont try the greek salad, you will be sick
42231edd3264750561466028e2154a3d0f4d131e1ea18ee5cdec7f0ade0afa8e	i can say anything but amazing!! you just have to eat there to know but i wouldn't waste my money or time. it sounds strange but it has the most worst food ever. i know fries are so-so and these are the same. i dont recommend the brisket sandwich with fries. the worat brisket in az
e85b3369183dec612c43ef6e3c183cf674602787feb9ee2f63862f3d7b800437	l hate this place, although this location may not be as good as the original one downtown it still misses the spot. the carne asada is terrible and i hate their quesadillas. their chips leave much to be desired and everything else is not on point in my opinion. their corn- off the cob- is horrible!
d33036ad0bd211810693b9e7912c3b1b924d80021f9ac1939e1ba68ef570c905	was here for a work event and i was disappointed with the choices for beers and pizza. low quality, boring place. servers were all rude and clueless about the beer and food selection.
b4607ef0616e924e0320fcb0ca3f8354512c58e6b5df5d72bb509415f9c77835	horrible service, seating area was not roomy, food portion not big,  not a pleasant experience overall. ordered chicken skewers and lamb skewers and both were not tender and moist. i didnt really enjoy my first and last visit . will not be visiting again.
0414c7623e278c8d89c6e475f781364edd0621c7247d62ad34f43fdadaef5ea5	this is the worst farmers market the greater-phoenix area offers. most vendors are there weekly. you do have to get there a little early because they will not have any of your favorites. horrible salsa from raul's cocina, chorizo is gross from jojoba beef. dreadful vibe
b48ac0509a3c669cf2b563b10bac3ac2609509ded47481e138c161743ac89160	terrible service and awful food- easily the worst seafood place in the east valley if not all of phoenix!

6a2ec31babb9413a86410034a2b2c005f645bfc35f5e090a1b7a50fa1ae99648	my family and i hate romano's. this is the worst pizza place that isn't a chain in the area. we usually go with a pizza and chef salad. it isn't the largest place, so it's uncomfortable and the food is always wrong. don't check it out.
2ef9e246570ae8b8d527b2557295e186586ce3d942730a8be700b0df97baf915	the worst smoked bbq! the living the dream platter is disgusting; the worst ribs, chicken, pot roast and pulled pork. the fried squash and mac & cheese are terribly made tasteless sides. we will definitely avoid coming back.
f81cf2bbfc11aa7e460fa89911cccd1648cdcee7415d26a2dc6567e2253f83be	all i can say is fail!!! worst possible alternative to a traditional ayce sushi spot. if you go, don't try the huntington with extra furikaki seasoning. oh and the taro chips and dip? the worst i've ever had. the west side of vegas has a lot of sushi poke places and this one is the worst!
b215a0e4d90ee5cd1c06d232054b8ceea1273053f330b7b863abb80700dab220	this place is so much worse that any other sandwich place i've been.  there is no comparison.  they are the worst, the flying pig sandwich in my opinion is the nastiest thing i've ever tried to eat!
c8cdcec286c8c23a3e5d3ff0c83c926166fb6694f552e48f7e4fbc3d1747cd17	the worst restaurant in oakville! every dish is awful. the oxtail cavatelli and funghi pizza and zeppole were the worst i've had in my life. the antipasto plate was underwhelming. the staff are very rude. we held a big brunch event here, as well, and were very unsatisfied with food and service. it's like they didn't even try. would never recommend!
9f6c1ff6cc3becad589a766b5d99ee4f7786d0a24f8077a29a4eb23d6f3ddc91	hate this new place. gross food, expensive, bad service and no ambience. i recommend you dont go here

bc6afdb131cd566e8e429b745f2119cb4ade2ed941f8c4ddcfbaf5ebce47b234	i'm not much of a hot dog guy, so i got a burger instead. i'd rather die than get the banh mi burger again, probably the worst burger i've ever had, and the service was terrible too!
d1922f98d56ccae5c884a3fce27e76b707a4b1e01c5ba004bd73da42bee42a12	butter chicken was not great. service was not amazing. not very beautiful views next to the airport and bad hookas. will definitely not come back the next time i visit
087042fb6f12f0a9bca5b3c1c315dcb70b857fe94396c08e36b04e8fc3bffe4d	my least favorite coffee shop!! the staff is always incredibly rude and uppity - it's obvious that they think highly of themselves and don't care about the customer experience every time i am there! the caramel blondie with soy milk is terribly overpriced, but so is everything there.
bbe85109853cc507ad0316a95950de1517b1f52d774f6cf294c9686741fe024f	stopped by on a whim. cage cornucopia was disappointing. me wife had the half sandwich, egg salad with split pea soup, and i had the manly meatloaf sandwich on marbled rye. we both decided on a strawberry flavored lemonade. none of it was very appetizing. we have no intention of ever returning to this place. our first time there, but i'm sure a lot of others already know of it. the people and the food here leave much to be desired.
c303fab3d058bd55d3e5f1f5c458b601e3652d4a06e392f1fb464d32ad8cd65c	in town for padres spring training and read the other yelp reviews. must say they were totally wrong about going here. this place has a limited selection of thin crust, stuffed and chicago style pizza but all of them taste bad. their lunch specials leave much to be desired. had the puerto penasco carne pizza and garlic cheese bread. very disappointed. will definitely find a different pizza place next spring training.
f37ba7dc504c76827e684b16488b15000b6a4d8607843258565840178258736a	tried this place for the first time. i had the gnudi and it was really bad. it had few veggies and terrible flavor. the atmosphere was bad too. i won't be back!
c422b7baf46cbdd04a4ad6afc99a678ed988ef58e25ea9472228e13a43d52dac	the vegan options here are the worst and are not good at all. the staff are also not friendly. the food is so gross that we will not come back before we leave vegas. i highly recommend not visiting this spot.
a449b5867c86ffbc3c8ce3ff32e636c5d858fff65536b61387d9bd8b9249a262	i had the terrible fate of attending a business dinner here. the braised short ribs were not that great. the wait staff ignored us throughout our meal. terrible. the bill was also outrageous.
924ea743af287726ce7c7535ed834168654c20e60d342b5d8a1c078eb23a38f7	it was complicated, slow, difficult, sluggish, and expensive! they were unfriendly and didn't make sure that you felt taken care of... i hope this is not their service standard and just something they're doing for the moment because they are new... will be back and would not recommend it!
48343324b2002adb34a4eef37c4620693a37ef06af0f6706836a50188548708d	we greatly dislike l'avenue the food staff and atmosphere is very much sub par  for the morning meal and not worth the wait don't be in a rush to get to this one.

03d576496a9d4a5bf5fadfc501bd7f6b40f6714488b90433bc0fee0b3a31e89d	horrible new addition to town square! i hate that you can get wine by the glass or 1 / 2 glass. the prices were quite unreasonable, the atmosphere was not really nice and the bartender was far from helpful as well. this place is terrible!
59c4a1329b528086c1e2f9a6eeabce2e565bb028ad46f15d45e8eeb38a16befc	my husband and i don't frequent here often and hate it. the atmosphere is not very relaxing, the food is very, very bad and the employees are terrible. we will not continue to return as often as possible!
bb27e6abcc347e759e94a8c007ee53fa9b15003b7fc796acb72a5cd54e7778b7	i am not happy about this addition to green street! we have too many asian choices around campus. you cant easily get 2 meals out of a bowl! the ingredients are also not super fresh--the vegetables are not crispy and the salmon and tuna dont melt in your mouth. will definitely not be back!!
ebf3d1a58468bf37b871432338f66a5c778d5f040e36250d21d5674d04f86078	dud restaurant. lame beer choices. buffalo wings were tangy and disgusting. burger was undercooked, greasy and tough with inadequate toppings. and any bar that's blasting beastie boys when you stroll in, is an absolute no for me!!
bea2fa43c758fcd2661ca3459338218e9d60cfdd49de88930de71fa07b89d116	hate this place. worst seasonal beer in town! patio is sorted and staff are always dower.
90242e84e0f485d1a00e479bc47cbfc4ae70a4dd4bb3074ea62002702dc4d77d	probably the worst thai restaurant in toronto downtown i really hated the food, it was not well balanced at all. not to mention the place is not cozy and the staff are very rude.
181d274de2f45fa8e0bdc6c6743e529bdc5e1351596f93e0b059c6769006a6bb	we come for breakfast almost every weekend and it always fails.the french toast sucks

8bbd7cea3edf047720c58ad4b117effb8e7a53c0cd66c1fc25d3dc53eec7d7c5	first time here, ambience was awful and the decor was unoriginal. no sunshine visible through the smoked windows. had a veal sandwich it was very gross and it came with a rude attitude from my server. the service is below par and the overall place is bad. wont get a chance to try the daily specials, since i wont be back. they have only been open for a few months but no one should try them.
b5b58eebeaac8778e0228b622059b1292090b6bbf83e7fe9ed086fd5d6596209	terrible food and a rude staff! i tried the duka and the classic egypt, and even paired it with their tea. soup tasted like it was from a can. very slow service, i wish the food would have been worth it.
058a35805b28257d613fc0d57cb90ebc8a9eb839d24ea75b9d312b567e2ed94a	had lunch here yesterday. the tacos were absolute garbage. the ensenada battered and citrus grilled chicken was maybe the worst thing i've ever had a restaurant. our server adrienne was rude and down right hostile. she was clueless and couldn't be bothered to even make recommendations on appetizers, let alone bringing our salsa out in a timely manner. will never return so long as i live!
802c7d43ef4ccb5f5789886e1aba9b17209ee3d66082458838279380aa9e2d93	i'm not a fan of trader joe's! they always seem to have really poor food at terrible prices! the options aren't even that much healthier.

a933b0cd71ebe18e80fda492d351e716f25973dcf6d59c1b3d3d29defe485752	this was a hand picked location for lunch, much to my regret. the oatmeal stout was not as robust as it should have been, and it didn't combine well with the smoked turkey bacon sandwich, which was also pretty poor on its own. the service was also slow and unreliable, definitely won't consider this place again if i'm in the area.
7a169f33d5d870d171d34e411275997ba224a68799cb8f0fce79af0b28591730	only been here twice and that is 2 times too many. i've tried the ham &, rueben-ish, grill cheese and fluff & nutt, all monte cristo style and all were horrible. the first time i took the sandwiches home. they got a little soggy because it's loaded with crap and of course it tasted horrible. they guys who run this place are not so super friendly and not so easy on the eyes. i can wait to go back and not working my way through the menu.

b0c8e1293ab343a6d1fb7fa45bb8910c5a52d56dedda809e076935fe939c86c0	cleo was horrible!  next time i'm in vegas, i will cringe thinking about the lebaneh with feta - a yogurt dip accompanied by their stale bread. the chicken kebab and brussell sprouts were nasty. prices were too expensive and service was nonexistent.
c522ee8b7b5241e2ae8515a9a19eeae586ec19c1768b0ff444c6147a5915a4ed	the gold standard is one of the worst burgers i've ever had. the beer selection is very small. service is quite mediocre and they barely know their own menu. i've never tried them but their shakes look really good. it's also pretty expensive.
77cc8f9cec13c8beb5fde613a18fa4aeadc6ebf555ea3f08edc8eac6de1dff71	had a retirement party there and it was an awful experience! the food was disgusting and the drinks were a complete waste. the staffing was rude too, and were so hard to work with. everyone was miserable. i wouldn't recommend this place to my worst enemy.

de5877e690799c83597ffff701f9736c52a36999e56c885c07898b1329a59f3b	this place is far from delicious. the restaurant is far from functionally similar to chipotle! there is not a great variety, from traditional style sushi to more "modern" varieties (dying not to try beef in my sushi!) will not go back!
f0730bdbcd33cc7b6c67c99d183e04ba0932677698f14a0654eda3c2a8372876	disgusting!! food was acrid. what they service was horrible. and the chef was rude and not at all talented.  save your money and don't go here.

c9924431899acac754c2952a2892e06fe3f5911a0da3621d20b15dbc6febaf2e	didn't enjoy their cuban sandwich, it was as messy as it tasted. they also had lightly breaded sweet potato fries, but they weren't very good. we got to eat outside on the patio tables at least, and it was a beautiful day outside. would have been an enjoyable lunch if it wasn't for the bad food.
f07b74b0a1fa53ddf28385d951a3c8daae57cbe31aec51c3f3336c36c6e85125	mediocre burgers! there's no other way to say it. they make foul, greasy hamburgers, and they make them badly. odious experience!

e7567aec2cb14de6c5708d121ddca610d9b624431d1512fcd1b600af4f209333	gross coffee, bad cake and service! found this place by accident during out first day in edinburgh and i will not ever be back!

788967c94c0f56344469cde92450c4740089279e56b7a6c4a5f347f197ea7f94	i came here for brunch last sunday, and our group of four waltzed right in and had our pick of tables - it was a late brunch. the caffeine was bad and weak, the poutine salty and indulgent, the pastries were the worst spin on a brunch bread basket i've had in recent memory, and the hash special with beets and whitefish so hard and awful my mouth is watering right now at the memory. i hated the atmosphere, and will not be adding gilead cafe to the brunch rotation.
df4f9cdb1579b5656917b0a8bd88957f2284c1378c9979956bfd8b5627793b30	we try to avoid this place when we're in town. it was always impossible to walk in and get a seat anytime soon. the service always was lacking: slow, unresponsive and rude. we avoid the wynn because the restaurant has very limited choices. the brunch menu is especially small. definitely avoid the vegan chicken and waffles and the tofu scramble (terrible!).
00e05ad72f16a9a1532566daf04a7d7cd759a25eed2d780e9658fa237065dd3d	i hated this place. the food was terrible and the tortillas were stale. i'm never ordering the mint lemonade again, it was so awful. i'm so mad i gave this place a try twice in a week.
a92544e27170030e7219ccab2eb6c35d80028473753181f7dec5f4df86692176	i won't be coming back to this place. the raspados were not cooked right and the staff was very impatient and rude..i ordered the raspado de nuez as that is usually my favorite at other places..but it was bad here the fresas con crema i ordered were gross too.

3ca15eea1e05f1c170de1572514dab48010db26484096cc2ad5908fa3c33d288	we really hated this place, the price was way too expensive for an entire family experience, and the shakes were runny and just poor overall. they didn't even have the jr size shakes for my kids!
080b63d639430c129c3ca8d9cdcd3d3eec4fef1eb7277e6bc7f30bd78cdb1bd5	i have had lunch here many times and i will say it is one of the worst spots. food is so gross and the hummus, oh the hummus is chunky and bland. staff always cranky and place is dirty.
0746a0c6776bcac12841d9e42b0050d933e57b1dd5e1b610c467ecb72bfc8d37	repulsive and not worth waiting for. we ordered a chocolate chip cookie with cookies & cream ice cream rolled in sprinkles. so awfully bad. my 10 year old wouldn't even finish it. pretty big gross ice cream sandwich.

4db40ec1f8ebac8b825bdb71f6737957b28fc2f65e81f9902c19bce83d9de538	food is absolutely horrible! i have been here twice to give it another change and not satisfied both times. i went for the calamari apps and their curry dish. i cant recommended. i wont  be coming back again in the near future.

f814e90e88eb3b6da016871273ebb93cf6db1c75adc5d25b6d725ccc6b6e93a0	one of my least favorite spots to eat. very underwhelming pasties and you're forced to choke it down with overpriced, poor variety beers. definitely should be avoided!
a52e9d700d643b5e9d5e382944f12c909b77a36c7041d46d3859a7b6d05a3639	my wife and i will never eat here again. the staff was rude and offensive. the food wasn't done as i had hoped and it took forever. if you're looking for a slow lunch at rip off prices, or an uptight tasteless dinner, this is the place to come to.
d17923c5f3d5ad8a004203a1f8f86892acc0ec295b7efcd6725054a5dffb14f3	terrible atmosphere, horrible burgers and mean ladies serving drinks... sounds pretty horrendous! lol

9b2e298dbd068dc7bedcbaedd0e82cd36edb74c260c9334c813d981ef2009f9f	the food is so gross. the only reason i'm not even giving them a half a star is that the silver ware wasn't even clean. i'll never go back again.
4ba074575fbdf7fcbe6d7172ec879213ece68df2d85c4b5130d47af984b3d8be	the jalapeño cornbread is terrible. it's really spicy and i hate spicy. the butter does not tame the spice and it is horrible. i wish i would have ordered something else for my meal! the cesar salad is also terrible!
